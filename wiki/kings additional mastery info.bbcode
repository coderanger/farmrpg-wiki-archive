[size=16][color=darkcyan][b]Gold Fish[/b][/color][/size][s]See: [[Gold Fish]]

The main way to get gold fish is through manual fishing. This can be a real pain if you're working on mastery. Make sure you are using ((Cat's Meow)), and if you can wait for a [[BITING]] event in the zone you're working in. Also, sometimes in-game events (generally around US holidays) give a bonus to manual fishing as well.

You can also get gold fish mastery from opening ((Grab Bag 07)), which mainly comes from your capybara pet, [ec], and some quests/[[Tower]] levels. If you're opening any of these for mastery, make sure you use a ((Mushroom Stew)).

For ((Gold Coral)), you can also open ((Mystical Chest 01)), which comes from some [[Tower]] levels, a few [cc], and a small few from quests. Make sure you keep 245 of these so you can keep getting the max amount as rewards in PHRs.

[size=16][color=darkcyan][b]Runestones[/b][/color][/size][s]
Runestone mastery is a slow process, and it mostly will rely on what other masteries you are working on. Some will come quicker than other based on where you explore or fish. You can get all runestones from pets, but some are brought by more than others. You will also get a few thousand of each from [[Tower]] levels.

Runestones 1-10 are in ((Grab Bag 04))(04), which comes from bear/capy pets.
Runestones 11-20 are in ((Grab Bag 05))(05), which also comes from bear/capy pets.
If you're opening these grab bags for mastery progress, make sure you use a ((Mushroom stew)).
