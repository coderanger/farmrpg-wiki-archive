[center]On the third day of the first month, the second year at sea, I saw an island in the distance. We found three buildings on the island: a blue barn on the eastern shore, a red shack on the beach closest to us, and off in the distance, a looming black tower. We decided it would be wise to investigate the buildings before making camp.[/center]
