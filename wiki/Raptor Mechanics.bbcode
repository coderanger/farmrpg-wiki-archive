* Raptors gain 1 soap every win, including when a stat point is gained.
* Raptors recover 10 hp per minute, or 20 hp if you have the couch perk.

* You fight anyone within your league regardless of their league rank.
* Your league rank is determined by your net wins within the league (wins minus losses)
* Your overall rank is determined by your net wins.
* Your league is determined by your total wins.


* Raptors battles consists of attacks with battle item rolls before or after.
* Per item a roll is made whether or not it gets used. Each item rolls separately. They do not impact each other.
* Multiple items can be used between attacks.
* Feather and sword get rolled before your raptor attacks, shield gets rolled before opponent's raptor attacks.
* Shield, sword and feather add 25% of your stat, rounded down, per usage. On multiple uses of the same item, they work multiplicative.
* Item stats remain active during the fight even if the item breaks.
* Exact workings of peach juice currently unknown. Range of 13-30 hp recovered found, independent of raptor max hp or current hp.

* You can 'retire' raptors that have a power level of at least 38 by going to a raptor and clicking the button underneath the fight log. You get raptor claws in return based on their power (1 claw per 25 power, with rounding) but they are permanently removed, can no longer fight, and lose all items they were holding.

* Retiring raptors has no effect on your antler/kebob gains.
