THIS IS THE SWEAR JAR FOR EPISODE 2 OF THE [[PODCAST] to see the most resent swear jar go to [[Swear Jar]]

The swear jar is a feature of the [[Podcast]]! 

We strive to make Farm RPG family friendly in chat, and in an effort to do so in the podcast we both blam swear words and penalize ourselves for accidentally swearing!

The pot starts at 100 gold and goes up by 5 gold every time we accidentally swear in the [[podcast]]!

Current Jar amount: 110 gold
