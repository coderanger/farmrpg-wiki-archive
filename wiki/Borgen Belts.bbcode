Borgen Belts have been showing up slowly over time. [user]Firestream[/user] has not shared any details of his plans for them yet. However we know that [[Puzzle Pieces]] are talked about in the [Roadmap] and will unlock a new exploring location. Belts seem to be following a similar pattern to puzzle pieces. Again to be clear, we currently have no confirmed information about what belts will be used for.
