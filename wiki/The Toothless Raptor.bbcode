The Toothless Raptor is the raptor with the longest losing streak while maintaining zero victories.
A perfect example of the lowest of the low.
The epitome of losing.
More a chicken than a raptor.

And, yet, the single most desired raptor title of them all.
Something truly epic to strive for!

If your Raptor has an even better streak, message Eldritch Cornness or Rkm13 and grab this title for yourself!
