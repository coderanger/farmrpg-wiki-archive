The Toothless Raptor is the raptor with the longest losing streak while maintaining zero victories.
A perfect example of the lowest of the low.
The epitome of losing.
More a chicken than a raptor.

And, yet, the single most desired raptor title of them all.
Something truly epic to strive for!


[b]Currently this title belongs to Lil Stinky
And the trainer Wiltingplant![/b]

This raptor is still chewing up the leaderboards, head over to the league standings and see for yourself. A screenshot will be posted when(or if) Lil Stinky ever gets a win.

[line]If your Raptor has an even better streak, message Eldritch Cornness or Rkm13 and grab this title for yourself!
