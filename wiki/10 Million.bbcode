What should you do with 10 million? Here are some suggestions in general order of importance.

- Buy the [[Quarry]] at crafting level 46 to get those Fancy Pipes ((fancy pipe)) going. See [[Sawmill Silver]] for more information

- Buy the 10 million silver upgrade for +2 daily [[Storehouse]] growth. See [[Inventory Growth]] for why this is so important

- Level 4 Owl for more honey! [[Honey Jail]]

- Be sure your [[Orchard]] is maxed out for your inventory size. You want to get the max possible fruit daily. More fruit = More juices = More stamina = More everything!

- The 10 million crop row gives you 10 million farming xp (one for every silver spent) and makes those crop quests and masteries a bit easier

- Keep those other production buildings upgrades, especially the ones used in [[Sawmill Silver]]

- [[Hay Field]] produces straw every 10 minutes and is great for making Twine ((twine)) into Rope ((rope)) into Fishing Nets ((fishing net))

Most other, non Owl, pets are really not all that useful until you get them to level 6 (1 billion silver). See [[Pet Guide]] for more info
