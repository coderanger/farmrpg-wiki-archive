4. One billion silver!: First max out orchard, then buy Storehouse upgrade, or crop row if it is an event xp bonus. Then consider the following:

Frog: A level 6 frog is quite nice and is often a person's first level 6 pet. Exploring level 68 unlocks a questline called &quot;Parts Unknown&quot; which eventually opens a new exploring area. One of the items needed in part XX(20) is 64 gold leaves. You can either get these from exploring a lot in forest(about 7k explores per drop), using the [[wishing well]] or by getting a frog to level 6 and getting 12 a day on average. Eventually 300 gold leaf and 300 gold feathers are needed for the tower. Also runestones 5 and 19 are important as you will see in a moment.

Macaw: At level 6, one of the best single pets for generating silver, more than green dragon. Use large nets in Minerva or Large Island and sell the fish. Also brings in Crab Claws(great for wishing well geckos) and Large Chest 02.

Snake: A level 6 snake brings in wine and skull coins. 50 skull coins are needed to get into the Pirate Cove fishing area and 700 Skull coins are needed for an endgame quest. Also runestone 15 can be important as you will see in a moment.

5. Collector quests: At levels 80x4, you will get 4 collector quests with a great reward (500mill silver). It seems like a great deal but, at this time, it is a trap. Those items are only used for those quests, and one other late game one. The other items you get aren't that great. So it's basically a 500million fee for getting not that much.

6. Runestones and Dragons!: Remember all of those hours you spent trying to find those runestones? Well you are about to be getting 12 of each a day. Runestones are important for a few quests but mostly for crafting Inferno Spheres and Lava Spheres that sell for a good price, especially when saved until events. (All prices are no event, no artisan with +60% sell perks)

Green Dragon: (Costs 1 billion to
 buy) Recommended to buy this first. It works by itself, unlike the Red Dragon which needs other pets to reach it's full potential. A level 6 GD will bring in 12 each of runestones 1-12 a day. 1-10 can be used to craft Inferno Spheres(About  36,000,000 silver a day)

Red dragon: (Costs 1 billion to buy) When you have red and green dragon, you are missing three runestones for the full set from pets: 15,19,20. There are two combos that get them: Either Frog+Tarantula or Frog+Squirrel+Snake. The second option is a bit more expensive (500M or so) but gives overall better goodies, like wine, besides the runestones. Lvl 6 Red Dragon brings in herbs and salt but is mostly useless until you combine it with those other pets. (About 72,000,000 million silver a day)
