Unpolished Jade ((Unpolished jade)) is very hard to get and is currently only available from [[Quarry]] (very rarely), the [[Pet Rock]] pet, Tower level 52, [[Mailbox Passwords]] and the soap shop in [[RFC]].

Occasionally new quests require it, and sometimes limited time quests. See [url=https://buddy.farm/i/unpolished-jade/]https://buddy.farm/i/unpolished-jade/[/url] for details.

[b]Pro tip:[/b] Hide jade ((Jade)) in your workshop and never craft it. You get plenty from ((Large chest 01))
