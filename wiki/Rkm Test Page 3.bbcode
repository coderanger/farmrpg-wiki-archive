7. Tower Prep: Now is the time to be thinking about the tower and other good pets. See &quot;A Towering Investment Checklist and Strategy&quot; by Badymaru for tons of helpful tips. Most pets should be in the lvl 4-5 range at this point, the following is for level 6:

Snake: If you haven’t gotten it already. Skull coins need hoarding. Also with the proper cellar perks(costs lots of gold) and 93+ farming level, wine will pull in 141 million silver per day on average.

Armadillo: Magna Quartz, Small Screws(also for Flywheels), Small Springs, Gears, Steel Wire, Steel. All needed for the tower in various amounts.

Baboon: Random nice things but Grape Juice is the star. It brings in 12 GJ a day.

Lemur: Brings in grasshoppers and dragonflys. 400 of each are needed for the tower. Both are tradeable, so you can go the trade/giveaways route if you want to but they can be hard to get sometimes.

Cat: Now the collector quests are nice with a 500million refund. Pearls and globbers are needed for the tower as well as a few quests. They are easy to find with nets but the cat can save you some time and nets. 250 shinefish are needed for a quest and they are hard to get from the exchange center.

Dog: 500mill refund from collector quest. 700 Cogwheels needed for the tower. They can be found in large chest 2 or fishing but are somewhat hard to get. Brings in Small Springs but they also come from armadillo.

Boar: Moonstones are needed for the tower. You can probably get enough moonstones from Ember Lagoon by crafting lanterns, if you want to go that route.

Rest of the pets: None of the rest are very important until you get the 99x4 pets. Buy them if you are a completionist or a hoarder.

8. 4x99: Congrats! So much clicking and so much time and you are finally here. Now what? What do you want to spend your hard won silver on?(All prices are no event with +60% sell perks)

Bear(usually the first bought): 1200 ancient coins from Large Chest 1, Inferno spheres(38.4 million silver a day) and honey

Blue dragon: Lava spheres and runestones (76 million silver a day from just lava spheres, not counting the runestones)

Capy: Gold fish from grab bag 7(I hate fishing so this was one I liked), Water lily, Drinks and Beets

Note: Grab bag 4 and 5 from bear and capy give you extra runestones

9. Runestones again: When you buy the blue dragon, if you haven’t already, you should level 6 those other RS pets: Squirrel, Tarantula, Hedgehog, Owl

Every RS has two pets that bring it in, except 12 and 17. Grab bag 5 from bear and capy make up some of the slack. Many people compensate for the lack of a 2nd RS17 pet with ember lagoon farming, but 12 hurts.


10. Other pets:

Strange Onion: Expensive, 10billion silver. Now with mega seeds, it brings in roughly 100mill a day, if you sell the crops, and pays for itself in around 100 days, depending on your perks. See Library page “Strange Onion” under “Fun Facts” for good info about it

Rock: 50 diamonds are needed for an endgame quest. Now is a good time to get your rock to lvl 6

Penguin: Um...supports a bit with octopus and squid mastery I guess? But that is very long term.

11. Level 7: If you have money to burn, bear is a good level seven pet. More AC is always nice. Otherwise the dragons and other RS pets are good.
