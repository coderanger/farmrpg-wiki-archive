We're seeing reports of excessive spam in giveaways related to games that monopolize the chat for long periods, and working on ways to reduce it.

In the meantime, please keep games in giveaways short, so that other players have time to use the chat to giveaway or ask for items. If you are wanting to host any type of longer game, [[trivia]], or giveaway that will take longer than about 10 minutes, message a Ranger [[FarmRPG Staff]] and we can work out a time and date that works for us both to have it in Trivia Chat.
