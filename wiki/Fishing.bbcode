[size=14][color=mediumslateblue]How to Catch a Fish[/color][/size][s]
First wait to see the fish's shadow appear, then tap it.

You will then see a moving blue dot that you need to tap fast enough to catch the fish. There are 4 possible patterns that will be at various speeds depending on your fishing location. The patterns may also be inverted.
Pattern 1 - Full swing right to left

Pattern 2 - Full swing right to left with a pause in the middle in one direction

Pattern 3 - Semi-full swing, offset a bit to the left or right
[img]https://i.imgur.com/IuRmjZH.gif[/img]
Pattern 4 - Half-swing from center to right

The dot will move faster in fishing zones you unlock at higher levels.

[hl=mediumseagreen]Tip[/hl]: Rather than chasing the dot with your finger or cursor, keep position on one side of the catch bar, and start tapping as the dot moves towards the edge.[/s]
[size=14][color=mediumslateblue]Fishing Streaks[/color][/size][s]
See [[Fishing Streaks]] for all the details.
Special baits, [farm supply] perks, & skill point perks stack with streaks.
[hl=mediumseagreen]Nets have no effect on fishing streaks[/hl]. Only manual fishing.

Drink ((iced tea)) to restore a lost fishing streak. 
Iced Tea is rewarded from quests, tradable, and available in the [[Flea Market]].[/s]
[size=14][color=mediumslateblue]Fishing Nets[/color][/size][s]
At Farming level 20, you can purchase a forest, which is the only location you can find ((antler)).
Fishing nets are mailable, antlers are not.
Fishing nets catch 10-15 fish at once (see [[perks]]).
The &quot;chance&quot; of getting each item is the same no matter how you fish, you're just getting more items at once.
Fishing nets can catch Runestones & Super Rares.
[b][i][color=crimson]Fishing nets do NOT increase your fishing streak, nor do they catch the Gold Fish mentioned below.[/color][/i][/b]

[color=#FF69B4]Large Nets[/color] ((Large Net))are available to craft at crafting level 92 and require 25 Fishing Nets. With the existing [supply] &quot;Reinforced Netting&quot; perk, Large Nets catch 400 fish per net (25 more than using 25 regular nets manually). Without the perk, it is a 1-to-1 ratio.

[size=14][color=mediumslateblue]Using, Losing, & Obtaining Bait[/color][/size][s]
To fish, you need some bait.
You can buy worms at the country store.
The rest you get from your farm buildings.

Different baits have special abilities. 
Click [[Baits]] to read about them!
All baits are mailable.

You lose 1 bait each time you miss or catch a fish.
There are some Bait Saver [[Perks]].
