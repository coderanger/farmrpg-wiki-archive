@Rkm13 Wait that flour comment gave me an idea. What about a library page dedicated for things you can start early which will greatly benefit people later on? Such as selling feed/flour to produce more for a head start on the GM, tossing things in well for ATI and other important quests, etc. Maybe brief mentions of certain things for very early players like how to use production and why it's good (sawmill, orchard, etc) and what to do early for major benefit, such as; recommending inventory space from gold and the perks+farm supply perks which should absolutely be bought first. Since the tier list doesn't actually give any direction in order. Or things like how people can make some gold early like doing a 1 gold charter+expedition for the two achievements
