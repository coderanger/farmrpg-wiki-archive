This is so I don't forget my work in progress(WIP) projects, and other stuff:

Make a bulletin board perk page with screenshots
[[Tips]]- Exploring effectiveness, keep orchard maxed to inventory cap, &quot;what should my production be?&quot;, FM gold and treat bags

Things needing updating:
[[best upgrades]] really old
[[Library Shortcuts]] constantly needs updating
[[Trade guide]] Add chat log and look up item info
[[Locksmith]] always needs updating with new stuff
Make one archive locksmith page
[[4x99 guide by jackie]]
[[ATI Guide]] update
[[gifts]] Make it organized by townsperson
[[Daily Chores]]

have you considered about modifying [[trade guide]] to make it more distinguished from [[giveaway guide]]

[[Testing]]
