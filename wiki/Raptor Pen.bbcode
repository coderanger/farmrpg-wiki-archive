This raptor has special requirements to obtain:
[s]The chicken raptor is obtained by having a raptor with less than 100 wins and 1000 or more losses overall. The raptor permanently gains this appearance if it meets these requirements. The game checks for this shortly after the beginning of each hour. [color=red]NOTE:[/color] The raptor must be actively fighting at that time to change patterns.
