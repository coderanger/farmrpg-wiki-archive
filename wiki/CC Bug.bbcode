Yes, the community center is bugged today, December 4th, 2023. Firestream will be able to fix it as soon as he is awake so please just be patient for a few hours. It will likely be fixed in the morning, server time (US Central Daylight Time, UTC-5).

If you are struck with an overwhelming urge to donate something, send your favorite staff member ([stafflist]) some trout!
