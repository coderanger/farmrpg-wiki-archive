[user]JulesShaun[/user] has made all the mistakes, so you don't have to!

For example [[at each end, or you can find the page in the library and click on the title, it will auto copy to your clipboard, then you just paste it see chat comm]]

One of the mistakes includes trusting [user]LinkJason10j[/user]. He is a scoundrel who supports the villain Ric Ryph. If you see this, send him a message letting him know how you feel about Ric.
