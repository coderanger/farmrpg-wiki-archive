[center][b]Many people ask the best way to get Exploring XP[/b][/center]

[b]Early Game:[/b] Most of the exploring areas give about the same XP until you get to Whispering Creek. So up to that point, don't worry about xp while you explore.

- Exploring is often the hardest and last skill to get to 99. (Except cooking which is still being developed).
- The best place to get exploring xp is Whispering Creek, except some event only locations. Despite giving slightly less xp, WC is better than Jundland in the long run because it gives fruit back.  Plus it has raptor eggs and other rare items!
-See [[LGCA]] for some useful things to do with all of those WC items
- Be sure to use ((Onion soup)) meal. You can ask for some in giveaways chat
- You can buy the Exploring Almanac gold perk which gives you 10% more XP when exploring. Also the Exploring Primer 1&2 perks each give you 10% more xp. With all three it is +30% exploring xp
- Events usually give 10% more exploring xp if you want to wait for one to happen
- From testing, it seems that both ((onion soup)) and primer perks have no effect on the xp you get from ((lemonade)) and ((arnold palmer)), but bonus xp from events do impact both lemonade and AP
