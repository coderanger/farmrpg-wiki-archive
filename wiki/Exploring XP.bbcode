- Exploring is often the hardest and last skill to get to 99. (Except cooking which is still being worked on).
- The best place to get exploring xp is Whispering Creek. Because it gives fruit back, it is better than jundland in the long run. https://buddy.farm/xpcalc/ Plus it has raptor eggs and other rare items!
- Be sure to use ((Onion soup)) meal. You can ask for some in giveaways chat
- You can buy the Exploring Almanac gold perk which gives you 10% more XP when exploring. Also the Exploring Primer 1&2 perks each give you 10% more xp. With all three it is +30% exploring xp
- Events usually give 10% more exploring xp if you want to wait for one to happen
