No, FRPG isn't getting botted!

On September 12, 2022 Farm RPG enabled a way to play the game without immediately registering an account, and as a placeholder a random name is generated with the prefix of 'Farmer' for their account.

Once a player plays for a bit with this auto-generated account they are asked to set their user name, password and email so that they can recover their account.

Play Now accounts are cleaned up and removed from the game after 14 days of inactivity.
