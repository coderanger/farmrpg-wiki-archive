[color= Mediumturquoise][b]What this is:[/color][/b] All the masterable fish currently in the game.  

[color= Mediumturquoise][b]Use:[/color][/b] Great for deciding which fish to grand master next for AK.  Or which route to take. 

[color= Mediumturquoise][b]Advisory:[/color][/b] The data over simplifies things.  For example, yes small pond is best for Drums.  But the other area has way many more fish, so while getting them you’re working on other masteries.  So take it with a big grain of salt. 

[color= Mediumturquoise][b]Second catch: [/color][/b] This assumed you have the cube artifact and will be using large nets.  However the numbers really don’t change [u]that[/u] much without them.  Or with regular nets.
