A common question when reaching Farming level 60 is &quot;Should I get the Flour Mill or the Feed Mill?&quot;. The answer is usually &quot;neither, yet&quot;.

The [[Feed Mill]] converts (some) crops into feed ((Feed)) used for leveling up pigs. This means it is only useful in combination with the Pig Pen which unlocks at Farming 70. There is very little reason to get one without the other so wait until you can get them both at the same time. Even then, slaughtering pigs does not bring in a ton of silver. Look at [[Slaughterhouse]] for the math. And to answer your next question: the easiest way to feed 250 pigs every day is to get a level 4 or above [[Gray Hedgehog]] which brings broccoli ((Broccoli)).

The [[Flour Mill]] turns wheat ((Wheat)) into flour ((Flour)), basically giving an extra +60% bonus to the selling price of wheat. This makes wheat by far the most profitable crop (1500 silver per hour for one plot) but this comes with the massive catch that you have to actually grow wheat to throw into it. At the point when you unlock the building, you've almost certainly got many weeks (or more) of growing specific crops for quests or for special drops ([[corn jail]], [[eggplant winter]], etc). At some point when 25 million silver isn't very much to you, definitely buy the building just for the XP but don't worry about that needing to be any time soon.
