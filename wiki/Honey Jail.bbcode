[b]Honey jail is real[/b][/center][line]

As of the June 24, 2024 update, when the Owl pet is level 6 or higher, it gives double the amount of honey. Honey jail is still a thing but not nearly as bad as it was.

*Generally speaking, you are 'in jail' if you are unable to make further progress because you are waiting on a specific rare drop (such as ((runestone 11)), see [[corn jail]]) or waiting for pets to bring you enough of a difficult to get item (such as honey) before you can complete the quest and continue making progress in the game.
