There are 20 Runestones hidden around Farm RPG that are used to unlock new exploring and fishing areas. Some runestones have easier ways to get them that are not obvious. Generally they are hard to get and the drops are very random. Most just require patience. [[Trust The Quest]]

[center][b]You CAN get Runestones from drinking lemonade, apple cider or using fishing nets. 
You can NOT get Runestones from Expeditions or Charters.[/b][/center]
Keep in mind that FarmRPG utilizes RNG for most things. Some runestones may take you a very long time to find, while others come relatively quickly. See [url=Buddy Farm Runestones]https://buddy.farm/search/?q=Runestone[/url] for approximate droprates.

[item]Runestones can be found while fishing, exploring, and farming as well as some other special ways. If you get one, even if you sell it, it will show on your profile as being found (but [[Dont Sell It]]!).[/item]
[item]You will need 1 of each runestone on your journey to complete the Inferno Sphere ((Inferno Sphere)) (1-10) and Lava Sphere ((Lava Sphere)) (11-20). [b][[Trust the quest]].[/b] See [[Rare Items and Locked Locations]]. Keep 1 of each sphere or you lose access to the zone.[/item]
[item][i]These runestones are also occasionally necessary for quests. Sometimes more than once. Might be worth checking the items detail page for quests remaining on those harder to get ones. [/i][/item]
[item]There is an Achievement for getting any Runestone that will reward you with 10 Gold. Another for finding 10 runestones that will award you with 100 gold, and one for finding all 20 for 250 gold.[/item]
