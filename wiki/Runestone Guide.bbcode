There are 20 [[Runestones]] hidden around Farm RPG. Some have good ways to get them that are not obvious. They are hard to get and the drops are very random. Most just require patience.

This is just the easiest way to get your first runestones. Check out [[Runestones]] for all of the ways and more info about what runestones are used for.
