This ranking system is the author's opinion. See [[Pet Shop]] for more details about each pet.
[color=red]Note: No pets will give you a return on your investment quickly. But they're very useful for passive, consistent silver.[/color]

[center][b][color=orange]Ordered from highest to lowest rankings, same ranking pets are in no particular order.[/color][/b]
Ranking based on appearance and item usefulness.[/center]

[b]Greater Capybara[/b]: 10/10[s] Actually the greatest. Grab Bag 7 for days, which contain gold fish. Also grab bag 4/5, cider, lemonade, and orange juice. There's nothing I don't love about the capybara.[/s]
[b]Blue Dragon[/b]: 10/10[s] Lava spheres. Also fills in the gaps to make additional spheres.[/s]
[b]Brown Bear[/b]: 10/10[s] Best items and a good boy. Large chest 01 aka more AC to spin the wheel!!!!!! Also brings keys, to open the chests (to spin the wheel). And grab bags 4 and 5 which have runestones.[/s]
[b]Green Dragon[/b]: 10/10[s] Inferno Sphere generator! Plus rs11&12.[/s]
[b]Red Dragon[/b]: 9/10[s]Half of the lava sphere set. Runestones 13/14/16/17/18. Also the cloak and lanterns at lv3 are nice income.[/s]
[b]Frigate Macaw[/b]: 9/10[s]Pirate items, exclusive fish, and um. Large nets.[/s]
[b]Tree Frog[/b]: 8/10[s]Somehow finds gold things. Runestone 19, gold feathers, gold leaves. 
[b]NOTE:[/b] If you still have quests remaining for ((gold leaf))((gold feather)), this might be a good investment as your first lv6 pet.[/s]
[b]Cobalt Tarantula[/b]: 7/10[s]Runestones & Rings! Runestone 05/10/15/20[/s]
[b]Pet Rock[/b]: 6/10[s] He has googly eyes. This lil dude also brings unpolished jade & other useful stuff.[/s]
[b]Green Python[/b]: 6/10[s]Wine and Skull Coins. Interchangeable with Mandrill Baboon as far as &quot;which one first&quot;. You'll eventually have both, but having one or the other is very important so you don't cry as much when townsfolk ask for them.[/s]
[b]Mandrill Baboon[/b]: 6/10[s]Grape juice & lemonade. Interchangeable with Green Python as far as &quot;which one first&quot;.[/s]
[b]Banded Armadillo[/b]: 6/10[s]Flywheels and crafting material.[/s]
[b]Strange Onion[/b]: 5/10[s]Cuteness factor made this one hard to place. Would win best in show, but only brings crops.[/s]
[b]Siberian Husky[/b]: 5/10[s] Large Clam Shells! Also: Small springs which otherwise are only found in a large chest. And cogwheels.[/s]
[b]Red Squirrel[/b]: 5/10[s] Gold Crab! Also brings RS20, which I never seem to have.[/s]
[b]Tawny Owl[/b]: 5/10[s]Goldfish! Oh, and honey.[/s]
[b]Magpie Cat[/b]: 5/10[s] Shinefish. Gold feathers and pearls are also nice.[/s]
[b]Wild Boar[/b]: 4/10[s]Jade Generator. Steaks.[/s]
[b]Gray Hedgehog[/b]: 4/10[s] Aside from broccoli, cheese, and extra OJ, not much else to note.[/s]
[b]Ring-Tailed Lemur[/b]: 3/10[s] At level 6, you just get lots of bugs, and Amber.[/s]
[b]Emperor Penguin[/b]: 2/10[s] Some passive silver from fish, that's really it. [[noot]][/s][line]
