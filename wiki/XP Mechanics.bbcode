[[Level XP]] has all of the actual numbers for each level. These numbers also apply to townsfolk friendship.

Each item has an &quot;XP value&quot; on the item page. This is how much XP you get when it is farmed/crafted/fished etc...

[b]Crafting:[/b]
[item]Craftworks gives no xp[/item][item]The extra items from resource saver perks give no XP[/item]
