[color=Blue]Zoom Bug[/color][s]

[color=Blue]Back Button Freak Out![/color][s]
[item]After you press the back button, the game just keeps cycling back through pages for a while. It sounds exciting, but I'm sure it's frustrating.[/item][item] This seems to happen in browser more often than mobile. Try to make sure you're using the in-game &quot;Back&quot; button rather than the back button on your browser.[/item][item]It also seems like pressing the back button quickly more than one triggers the issue, so try to space out your presses or use other buttons like &quot;Home&quot; instead.[/item][item]Another method to avoid this is swipe right from the left side of the screen in mobile to go back without having to worry about going back too quickly.[/item][/s]
[color=blue]Missing Chats[/color][s]
[item]Sometimes when you load the game, you'll only see a couple chat channels instead of all of them.[/item][item]Refresh the game and everything should go back to normal.
