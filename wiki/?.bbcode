On 2024-11-10 at approximately 22:04:33 [[server time]], [user]Ffff[/user] pressed a button without really understanding what it would do. The result was the creation of this blank library page, which was only discovered 3 days later.

This page stands as a monument to remind him to not just press buttons all the time with zero regard for the future. For now. Later it will probably be pictures of cat-capybara hybrids. Or Numbats. Have you ever even seen a Numbat? They're awesome and I want one. Unfortunately our Australian farmers don't want to ship them over here. I'm still waiting.
