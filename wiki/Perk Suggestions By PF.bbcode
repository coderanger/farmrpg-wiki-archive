[center][size=18][b]New Player Perk Guide[/size]
[size=16]By [user]PopcornFireworks[/user][/b][/size]
[b]This guide is just my recommendations, and may or may not work for you and your playstyle.[/b][/center]
Are you new to Farm RPG and overwhelmed by the amount of perks and farm supply upgrades? Want to know what’s relevant to you, a new player, and what you probably don’t need until late game? This guide is for you!

[size=16]This page covers Farm Supply Gold Upgrades. Skill Point Perks are on [[Perk Guide Part 2]][/size]

[b]Notes:[/b][s][item]Check out [[Perks]] for a more detailed description of what these perks do.[/item]
[item][b]This guide currently does not include Cooking perks, Millions of Peaches, or Farm Dashboard.[/b] If you are a new player, you probably don’t need to worry about any of these. If you are Farming/Crafting 75+, have unlocked Cooking, and need advice about which perks to get, help chat will be happy to help.[/item]
[item]See [url=Perks Guide]https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1-mSifXb-tVRxVVIF3ZGd8FtySQ4quUfZWWMZnysmj0c/mobilebasic[/url] for the original[/item][/s]
[b][size=18][color=Darkgoldenrod]Farm Supply Gold Upgrades[/color][/size][/b]
It is feasible to get the upgrades you need without buying gold for money, but it will take time. You get a fair amount of gold early on from quests and easy achievements, and late game you get gold from both mastering and grand mastering items. However, in mid game as your leveling slows, you will get new quests less frequently and they take longer to complete, so spend your gold carefully. 

Check out [[Gold Currency]] for more information about gold, and take a look at the Gold Guide in [[Community Guides]] if you want another opinion on gold upgrades.

[size=17][b]Quality-of-Life Upgrade[/b][/size]
These are a bit more subjective, but there are some you definitely need.
[s][size=14][b]Most important[/b][/size]

[item]Iron Depot (125)[/item][list][item]The most important thing about this perk is that it removes iron and nails from the exploring pool, which increases your chance of getting other rarer items.[/item][item]Note that it buys iron and nails for you, they are not free. Check out [[Ironworks vs Iron Depot]].[/item][item]Suggested to purchase when iron and nails go from being expensive for you to buy, to being a chore to go to the store and buy.[/item][/list][item]Pet-o-Matic I & II (25, 25)[/item][list][item]Do you want to individually pet 250 chickens and cows every day? No? Buy this perk.[/item][/list][item]Feed-o-Matic I (25)[/item][list][item]Same as Pet-o-Matic. Get this when you get the pig pen.[/item][/list][item]Inventory Monitor (150)[/item][list][item]This perk will change your life. As soon as you are regularly using fishing nets, lemonade, or apple cider, inventory monitor is necessary to minimize accidentally voiding items.[/item][/list]
[size=14][b]Useful Bulk Options[/b][/size]

[item]Fish Supplier (25)[/item][list][item]More useful once you can craft large nets.[/item][/list][item]Send-o-matic I (25) - Cows[/item][list][item]You can select the number and level of cows to slaughter if you prefer to keep your highest level cows for milk production and/or sentimental value.[/list][/item][item]Send-o-Matic II (25) - Pigs[/item][list][item]Especially useful if you plan to produce bacon for silver.[/item][/list][item]Collect-o-matic (25)[/item][list][item]Collect all pet items with one click. Essential once you have a good number of pets.[/item][/list]
[b][size=14]Less Useful Bulk Options[/b][/size]

[item]Wine-o-matic (50)[/item][list][item]Check out the Wine Cellar Upgrades section below before buying this. Without upgrades, you will be averaging 2-3 wine sold per day and probably will not need bulk options.[/item][/list][item]Distributor I (50)[/item][list][item]Honestly, you probably should not be selling crops. Save them for quests.[/item]
[item]Maybe consider this late game if you have 4+ grape juice uses and your inventory is mostly full of crops.[/item][/list]
[b][size=14]Depends on your playstyle[/size][/b][item]Yes I’m Sure (75)[/item][list][item]Is clicking “Yes” tedious? Get this.
Does the thought of accidentally crafting or using something stress you out? Do not get this.[/item][/list][item]Cinnamon Sticks (50)[/item][list][item]Apple cider uses 1250 stamina instead of 1000 stamina.[/item]
[item]Only really worthwhile if you primarily explore via apple cider.[/item]
[item]Late game, this perk has minor effects on items-per-explore efficiency when using ciders, but you do not really need to worry about that until after you have unlocked the tower (source: discord post by cfedey)[/item][/list][item]Pet Whistle (25)[/item][list][item]Adds a “collect all” button to your home screen to collect all pet items easily. Great if you frequently forget to collect from your pets (you can also set a minimum number of ready items in Settings).[/item][/list][item]Bulletin Board (25)[/item][list][item]Great perk if you have trouble keeping track of multiple help requests and how much you have left to complete them.[/item][/list]
[item]Quick Craft (125)[/item][list][item]Adds the option to craft the item from the item description screen. Good for later game when you want to finish quests without going all the way to your workshop.[/item][item]Expensive for what you get, but up to you if the convenience is worthwhile.[/item][/list][item]Quick Sell (125)[/item][list][item]Adds the option to sell the item from the item description screen. Good for later game if you want to quickly sell items without going all the way to your farmers market.[/item][item]Expensive for what you get, but up to you if the convenience is worthwhile.[/item][/list]

[b][size=14]You probably don’t need these:[/size][/b]

[item]Mastery Tracker (125)[/item]
[item]Wheel Grease (50)
--Just makes the spinning animation faster, no tangible benefits.[/item]

Good but not vital

[item]Extra Wish/Wishes (25, 125)
--Do not use gold to throw things into the well, buy the Extra Wish perk instead.
--If you are missing one of runestones 1-10 for a quest, need gold leaves or are preparing for ATI, one extra wish is a good investment. [[Wishing Well Tips]].
--Opinions on the utility of extra wishes after unlocking the tower are mixed, so consider whether you think the 5 Extra Wishes is a good investment for your playstyle.[/item]
[item]Toolbox I (25)
In the early game, the silver cost to craft items is not very significant (most of the cost is buying iron and nails, which this does not affect), so this perk does not save much silver. It will add up over time, but other perks are usually a better investment. 
--Once you have a steady income of runestones [[Pet Moneymaking Guide]] this perk is useful for increasing your sphere profits.[/item] 

Depends on your playstyle

[item]Wheel Credit, Boost, and Bonus (75, 75, 50)
You will probably get these at 4x99 (there is a pet that brings you ~1200 Ancient Coins per day), but if you like spinning the wheel these are worth getting earlier.[/item]
[item]Codebreaker (100)
--If you do not want to spend 50 ancient coins on extra guesses at the vault, this is a good perk. If your guess rate is 4.5, this will save you about 25 ancient coins per day on average.
--This upgrade is not especially monetarily valuable, but I have found I enjoy the vault more having the extra guess.[/item][/s]

Wine Cellar Upgrades - some of them are okay I guess
[s]Don’t prioritize the wine cellar, most other upgrades are more important. By the time you have enough gold to buy all these upgrades you will be making a lot more silver elsewhere, and the wine cellar will seem like small potatoes. See Appendix: Large Net Gold-to-Silver Ratio.

Don’t expect to be able to fit all of your wine in the cellar - eventually you will be producing way more than your cellar can keep up with, and you will need a lot of wine for quests. 

Check out the [[Wine Cellar]] page for wine math. You will need to calculate whether the per day silver increase for each upgrade is worth the gold you’re spending (it probably won’t be). 

[b]Note that the following calculations assume farming level 99.[/b]
With all the perks (1500 gold, not recommended), the wine cellar makes: (350 bottles / 37 days to reach max value) * (15 million silver / 1 bottle) = 142 million silver/day. 

With no upgrades at all, the wine cellar makes: (100 bottles / 44 days) * (8 million silver / 1 bottle) = 18.4 million silver per day. 
 
[item]Cellar Insulation (75)
--Wine reaches maximum value about two weeks faster. With no other wine upgrades, this comes out to roughly an extra 8 million silver per day.[/item]
[item]Fancy Bottle and Designer Bottle (50, 125)
--Because wine growth is exponential, the higher price cap only adds a few more days in the cellar. 
--With the “Fancy Bottle” perk and no other wine upgrades, the wine cellar makes about 21.3 million silver per day. With both the “Fancy Bottle” and “Designer Bottle” perks, the wine cellar makes about 29.4 million silver per day.[/item]
[item]Cellar Expansion I&II (50, 150)
--There are more of these upgrades, but each one only gives you 50 more spaces for wine, and they get absurdly expensive. 
--Going from 100 spaces to 150 spaces with no other perks is an increase of roughly 8.9 million silver per day.[/item]

With Cellar Insulation, Fancy Bottle, and Cellar Expansion I, you spend 175 gold total for a resulting (150 bottles / 33 days) * (10 million silver / 1 bottle) = 45.5 million silver/day, an increase of 27.1 million silver per day from no perks. 

With Cellar Insulation, Fancy Bottle, and Cellar Expansion I&II, you spend 325 gold total for 60.6 million silver/day. Adding Cellar Expansion II gets you 15.1 million more daily silver at the cost of 150 gold, which is a lower daily silver per gold value. 

[b][size=16]Do not get these :([/size][/b]

[item]Cellar Expansion III-V (250, 350, 450)
--Absurdly expensive and not worth the gold.[/item] 
[item]Skill Almanacs (25 each)
--Useless once you get to level 99, and non-refundable. Get the perk points Skill Primers if you are having trouble leveling.
--Exploring Almanac is worth considering if you have both Exploring Primers and are still having difficulty getting to level 99.[/item]
[item]Banker I-III (25, 50, 100) and Savings Account I-V (50, 250, 500, 500, 500)
--This looks like a lot of silver early game, but it really isn’t. Once you have unlocked the highest level fishing area, you could use the same amount of gold to buy large nets in trade chat, and immediately make more silver than these perks would make in four years. (see Appendix: Large Net Gold-to-Silver Ratio)
--Also, you should be spending your silver to upgrade your Sawmill Silver and orchard, not putting it in the bank.[/item]
[item]Flour Power and Feed Boost (75 each)
--The only reason to get this is if you are trying to grand master flour or feed, and that is still a loss of 45 gold each. You do not need it for silver or to feed your pigs.[/item]
[item]Star Map (250)
--Charters and expeditions are not a good use of gold.[/item][/s]

Appendix: Large Net Gold-to-Silver Ratio
[s]TL;DR: 
You get more silver per gold buying large nets in trade chat than the bank or wine upgrades will earn you in several years. 
Longer Version:
The bank and wine cellar upgrades cost gold to increase passive silver generation, so you get a little bit of silver every day. However, once you reach farming level 99, you can also effectively buy silver with gold by purchasing large nets from trade chat. This means that whenever you buy an upgrade to passive silver, you need to consider how long it will take that silver to match what you would get if you bought large nets now. 
Once more, with math: 
Trade ratio for LN as of September 2022: 1000 LN for 100 gold (likely to increase with time, i.e. you can get more nets per gold).

As calculated in a spreadsheet linked on Badymaru’s ATI Guide page, you get roughly 6,338,789 silver per large net in Pirate’s Cove (with 60% negotiator perks, all PC fish mastered, no tower perks, no event)

Bank Perks: 
Gold cost of all bank perks: 1975
For 1975 gold, you get 19,750 nets * 6,338,789 silver / net =125,191,082,750 silver
Maximum daily bank income: 80,000,000 silver
125,191,082,750 silver / 80,000,000 silver per day = 1,564.8 days (4.3 years) to earn the same amount

Wine Perks:
Gold cost of all wine perks: 1500
For 1500 gold, you get 15,000 nets * 6,338,789 silver / net = 95,081,835,000 silver
Maximum daily wine income: 142,000,000 silver
95,081,835,000 silver / 142,000,000 silver per day = 669.6 days (1.8 years) to earn the same amount
