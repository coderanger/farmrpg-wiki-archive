Trust the quest, the writers put a lot of hard work into making sure each quest has a good and fair progression of rewards, even though it may not seem like it at first. Also, [[read the quest]] if you're stuck and not sure how to continue :)

[s]An exception are the &quot;Strange Companions&quot; and the &quot;Defenses and Consequences&quot; questlines. It is a pretty cool quest but it asks for a bunch of really hard items to get. This was fine when it was released but it doesn't really lead to any significant rewards and they released later quests like &quot;A Towering Investment&quot; that ask for a lot of the same items that are much more important to do. In the end you will complete them both, but it may be better to hold off for a bit.[/s]
