[b]How does it work?[/b]
You have a referral code that can be found at the bottom of the [settings] page.  You can give it to people so that they can enter it when they sign up to play the game.

[b]What do I get?[/b]
When a player that used your code reaches Farming Level 30 two things happen:
- You get a Gift Basket 02 ((Gift Basket 02))
- The player that used your code gets a Gift Basket 01 ((Gift Basket 01))

[b]How do I get a code to give out?[/b]
Just go to [settings] and look for Referral Code near the bottom.

[b]I've been here a while, can I put in a Referral Code still?[/b]
Sorry, for now, no.  It is possible this becomes available in the future.  Right now the codes are for new accounts only.  You can still grab your referral code in [settings] to give out to your friends though.
