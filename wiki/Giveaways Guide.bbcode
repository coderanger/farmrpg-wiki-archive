[center][b][size=22][color=limegreen]Guidelines for Donating & Receiving items[/color][/size][/b]
This page is a general guide to help maintain a nice chat environment. This guide is specific to Giveaways Chat. For regular trading, see [[Trade Guide]]. When this guide says &quot;Trading,&quot; it means &quot;sending or receiving items.&quot; It's just shorter to say it that way![/center]

You must be Lv10 Farming to trade
How to post [color=limegreen]item icons[/color]: ((item name)) - ((lemonade))
How to [color=limegreen]tag someone[/color] in a message: Click emblem to the left of their username.
[color=limegreen]Actually Trading[/color]:
1.Check [[Mailable Items]].
[size=12]You can also see if an item is mailable by looking at the item description. 
Example:((mushroom)) is mailable, ((catfish)) is not.[/size]
2.Ask politely for the item you need in giveaways chat, you don't need to offer something in return.
3.In Giveaways Chat, people give items for free but always clarify if you're unsure.

[color=limegreen]Sending items[/color]: Click their username -&gt; mailbox -&gt; send.
If their mailbox is full, click check again and/or ping them in chat to alert them.
Be sure to [color=limegreen]clear your mailbox quickly[/color].
If you received free items, say thank you![/s]

[/s][line][center][size=20][color=limegreen][u]General things to consider[/u][/color][/size][/center]
Be polite. You're talking to real people who are giving you free stuff.[s]A lot of the materials sent in giveaways chat for free could easily be sold in Trade Chat. Folks are here because they want to help you, so please show some gratitude in return.

On the other hand, if someone isn't saying &quot;please&quot; or &quot;thank you,&quot; it's not your job to call them out or try to &quot;coach&quot; them into being kinder. If you're not happy with how someone conducts themself, just don't send them anything![/s]
Clear your mailbox [color=limegreen]quickly[/color] when you're expecting items.[s]You can clear your entire mailbox by clicking &quot;Collect all items&quot; & press &quot;check again&quot; if you're expecting a lot.[/s]
[color=limegreen]Space out repeat messages.[/color] Do not spam chat with the same message.[s]A good buffer time to paste similar messages is at least 5 minutes apart AND your previous message is no longer visible by scrolling down. If nobody is interested, try again later.[/s]
If you have an issue with another trader, [color=limegreen]Do not &quot;call out&quot; issues publicly in chat.[/color][s]Flag any messages that violate [coc] and report any urgent issues to someone on [Stafflist] who is online. We can handle issues privately.[/s][line][center][size=20][color=limegreen][u]OTHER[/u][/color][/size][/center]
[center][size=18][b][color=red]If you ask for gold in giveaways chat, you will probably get gold veggies instead![/color][/b][/size][/center]
[color=limegreen]Raffles[/color]
[s]If you want to do a raffle, you need to ask for useless items. The reason is that some people have asked for valuable items, such as gold, claiming they will give them back as prizes. But then they only give some of the gold out, or none at all and it is up to mods to try and sort through what happened. So, asking for ((feathers)) as a raffle entry is ok, asking for things like ((5 gold)) event items and rare items are not ok. No giveaway or raffle is permitted to benefit the organizer by keeping or using any portion of prizes that were donated.[/s]
[color=limegreen]Giveaways Chat[/color]
Not recommended for trading, great for donating.[s]Use this chat to offer free items out, whether it's an &quot;@ me for free oak&quot;, &quot;guess my dogs name for some oj&quot;, or some very short (1-2 question) trivia type thing. 
Basically, use this chat for anything that will cause multiple people to respond to your message to receive free items.[/s]
Off Topic Conversations:[s]
[b]Some[/b] off topic convo is okay, just be aware that you may get drowned out from people giving out free items, and that lengthy personal conversations may be better said over DM or on [discord] privately.

As always, the [CoC] must be followed at all times.

TRIVIA CHAT: See [[Trivia]][/s]
Check out [stats] near the bottom to see what people trade the most.

If an item you need is not in the [[Mailable Items]] list[s]
Check for a location.
Check [[Find it]] & [[Wishing Well]].
It may also be a quest reward.[/s]

If you loan out items or gold, and something goes wrong (such as the other person not paying you back), you are on your own. Mods do not have time to police that sort of thing and will not get involved.
