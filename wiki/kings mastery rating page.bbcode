[table][tr][th]Item[/th][th]Rating[/th][th]Best Method[/th][th]Notes[/th][/tr][tr][td]Amethyst Necklace ((Amethyst Necklace))[/td][td]2[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Quick to gm, or MM, while working on other Highland Hills masteries. Can also get from opening ((Medium Chest 02)), 5 each.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Apple Cider ((Apple Cider))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Crafting, Quests[/td][td]Fairly easy to master, GM will take some time. You also get a good amount from quests and some from pets over time. If you care about GM, use ((Mushroom Stew)) when claiming large amounts from quests.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Aquamarine Ring ((Aquamarine Ring))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Needs paste, but pretty cheap and quick overall. Not much else to do in Small Spring though while collecting ((Aquamarine)), so try to make the most of the ((Feathers)) you get while working on this.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Arnold Palmer ((Arnold Palmer))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting, Quests[/td][td]You will always want to turn your lemonade into AP, but this will probably take a long time to GM. If you care about GM on this, make sure you're using ((Mushroom Stew)) for quests that reward more than a few hundred.[/td][/tr][/table]
