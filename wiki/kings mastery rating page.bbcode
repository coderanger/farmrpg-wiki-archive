Last edit: 26 Nov - Added several new items, fixed typos. Table is now sorted by rating, which many people have asked for.

A few notes before you dig in:
[list][item]Fish masteries are generally considered way easier than other masteries, as there is very little effort involved. This is even more true after you unlock [[Tower]] level 70, which makes Large Nets more efficient.[/item][item]Some items that I list as passive may still take a lot of time to finish, but they will have very low difficulty ratings, because they can be done completely by production buildings and [[craftworks]].[/item][item]Event or limited time masteries are not included.[/item][/list]

[table][th]ITEM[/th][th]RATING[/th][th]BEST METHOD[/th][th]NOTES[/th][tr][td]Barracuda ((Barracuda))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Very very low effort, just use ((Fishing Net)) and ((Large Net)) in Large Island. Make sure to sell these for silver.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Board ((Board))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting, [[Sawmill]][/td][td]Boards are most people's first mastery and GM.

Costs a bit more ((Board)) than some others, so this is great for overnight crafting.

This will come fairly quickly.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Butter Churn ((Butter Churn))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Can be made entirely from passive production via craftworks. You should work on this the same time as you're doing ((Wooden Barrel)), and due to resource saver you should get this first. Don't worry about turning them all into ((Butter)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Clam Shell ((Clam Shell))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Very easy Emerald Beach fishing mastery. Reasonable to MM, even.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Conch Shell ((Conch Shell))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Very easy Emerald Beach fishing mastery.

It drops in all 4 of the first fishing zones.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Emerald ((Emerald))[/td][td]1[/td][td][[Locksmith]], Crafting [/td][td]You shouldn't really worry about crafting these much, unless you spend a lot of time in Mount Banon. You'll get more than enough to GM from opening ((Large Chest 01)) for ((Ancient Coin)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fancy Pipe ((Fancy Pipe))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Very easy, profitable mastery to work on early. Can be done 100% passive if you want, just make sure to sell when your inventory fills.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Flamejack ((Flamejack))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Quick Lake Minerva mastery. Make sure you sell as you go, it adds up.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Frosteye ((Frosteye))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]A quick and painless Glacier Lake mastery. Should be the first or second you get once unlocking the zone.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Garnet ((Garnet))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]You should be crafting these as you explore Whispering Creek for ((Raptor Egg)) and levels. You really want to craft ((Garnet Ring)) if you can, but sometimes the paste need is too high, in which case you can just sell.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Glass Bottle ((Glass Bottle))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]You don't need to worry about focusing bottles specifically, you will naturally GM them by crafting daily juices and working on ((Lantern))[/td][/tr][tr][td]Glass Orb ((Glass Orb))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]You will naturally master these while working on other GMs/daily production. [[Glass]].[/td][/tr][tr][td]Glassback ((Glassback))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Quick Glacier Lake mastery.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Green Barracuda ((Green Barracuda))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Fast Pirate's Cove mastery.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Green Parchment ((Green Parchment))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Very cheap, very quick. Turn these into diaries please.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Hammer ((Hammer))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Pretty much the cheapest ((Mushroom Paste)) mastery. Do your best to craft these into ((Essence of Slime)) or ((Salt)) as you go,  or the [ec] trade for ((Bell)). If you just want to knock out a quick GM though, they're cheap enough to make later that selling shouldn't set you back much.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Horseshoe ((Horseshoe))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]A quick ((Stone)) mastery. Can by done completely passive through Quarry/Craftworks if you want. These sell for decent silver.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Ice Shark ((Ice Shark))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]The slowest Glacier Lake mastery, but still super fast with how much time you'll spend there for silver.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Iron Cup ((Iron Cup))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Very very cheap to craft.

Very reasonable MM as well, or a cheap item to manually craft for the Grand Artisan merit badge.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Iron Ring ((Iron Ring))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Very cheap, very important for many other crafts. I would definitely recommend putting this in your craftworks after you unlock a few slots.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Jumbo Fish ((Jumbo Fish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]You should be fishing plenty in Pirate's Cove for silver while you work on leveling and unlocking Glacier Lake and tower levels.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Ladder ((Ladder))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]You can make these completely from passive production.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Largemouth Bass ((Largemouth Bass))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Easy fish from multiple locations.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Leather ((Leather))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Byproduct of exploring the forest for nets, and also used in many other masteries. You can technically get leather by killing cows, but I would recommend against that, as it reduces your ((Milk)) production.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Lemon Quartz Ring ((Lemon Quartz Ring))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Pretty easy and cheap. You get all the materials needed from exploring in Cane Pole Ridge, you'll just need to top up on paste every once in a while.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Mulberry Snapper ((Mulberry Snapper))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Quick Pirate Cove mastery. Very easy once you unlock the zone, and great for silver.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Mushroom ((Mushroom))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Exploring[/td][td]You should be exploring forest all the time for ((Antler)). But they also come from several other zones you should explore for other masteries. I would not recommend growing these.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Mushroom Paste ((Mushroom Paste))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Paste is the base for many other crafts. There will be a point on your road to masteries that paste will be the root of all your troubles. Luckily you get mushrroms from exploring multiple zones, and you can grow them yourself. You will likely MM paste with multiple GMs that use it still not finished.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Orcafish ((Orcafish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Another Pirate's Cove mastery. Quick and painless.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Pearl ((Pearl))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing, [[Locksmith]][/td][td]Very easy GM.

Can do these any time, but I'd recommed waiting until they are the CC item, or you can send them to [user]Lorn[/user] or [user]Holger[/user][/td][/tr][tr][td]Peppers ((Peppers))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]The quickest growing crop. Gm is technically very quick, but requires constant monitoring to be the most effective. Alternatively a few uses of ((Breakfast Boost)) will get this done super quick.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Plumbfish ((Plumbfish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Quick gm once you unlock Large Island.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Purple Butterfly Fish ((Purple Butterfly Fish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Very quick and easy PC fish.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Redgill ((Redgill))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Slower Minerva fish, but still quick and painless.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Rope ((Rope))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]You will live and breathe ((Rope)) before long.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Ruby ((Ruby))[/td][td]1[/td][td][[Locksmith]], Crafting[/td][td]Opening ((Large chest 01)) for Borgen shop and the wheel will make this mastery go quickly. Craft into rings if you can afford the paste.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Ruby Coral ((Ruby Coral))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]You should be doing plenty of fishing in the Large Island for silver, so this should come very quickly.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sand ((Sand))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Exploring[/td][td]Not worth working on until you fully unlock Jundland Desert, but when you do it will come very quickly.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sea Catfish ((Sea Catfish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Another quick and painless Large Island gm.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sea Crest ((Sea Crest))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Another Glacier Lake fish. Should come shortly after unlocking the zone.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Seeker ((Seeker))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]After unlocking Glacier Lake, this will come very quickly.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Serpent Eel ((Serpent Eel))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Fishing at Large Island for silver to progress and upgrade production buildings will make this come naturally.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Shimmer Stone ((Shimmer Stone))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Used to make ((Glass Orb)) from ((Unpolished Shimmer Stone)). I don't think you ever need to focus on this mastery, it should happen over time as long as you're crafting up your ((Unpolished Shimmer Stone)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Shimmer Topaz ((Shimmer Topaz))[/td][td]1[/td][td][[Locksmith]], Crafting[/td][td]You [b]can[/b] craft this, but you will most likely get GM and more just from opening ((large chest 01)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Shovel ((Shovel))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Nice and easy wood, mushroom, and stone craft. Can send to [user]Ric Ryph[/user] for some friendship xp, or wait til a valid CC day.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Shrimp ((Shrimp))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Quick Vast Ocean mastery. Send these to [user]Lorn[/user] for friendship xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Skipjack ((Skipjack))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]This is one of the highest drop rate fish, and is the highest for Vast Ocean.

You should fish here a good bit when you unlock it, so GM will come naturally.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Starfish ((Starfish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Emerald Beach has lots of masteries, and this is one of the quicker ones.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Steel ((Steel))[/td][td]1[/td][td][[Steelworks]][/td][td]Once you unlock [[Steelworks]] this will start coming pretty quickly.

[[Sawmill Silver]]. They're still a great way to turn passive production into silver at any point in the game.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sunfish ((Sunfish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Super quick Crystal River mastery. Nothing special about them though.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Swordfish ((Swordfish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]The fastest Large Island mastery. Doesn't really look like a ((sturdy sword)) though to me.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Torch Fish ((Torch Fish))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]The highest drop rate fish in the entire game (mostly because Minerva only has like 4). You will likely struggle to not void these as you work on mastery. A lot of people don't sell in Minerva, but it's honestly worth it if you remember.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Trout ((Trout))[/td][td]1[/td][td][[Trout Farm]], Fishing[/td][td]You can fish for these, or upgrade your trout farm a bit and bask in the glorious free mastery every day at reset.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Twine ((Twine))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Very easy mastery, GM, and even MM. You will need to make tons of twine for other masteries and to make rope for nets.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Unpolished Shimmer Stone ((Unpolished Shimmer Stone))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Exploring[/td][td]Explore for these. ((Emberstone)) is needed for too many crafts to be using it on glass. It doesn't really matter where you explore, just make use of the other materials in that zone and you'll be fine.[/td][/tr][tr][td]White Parchment ((White Parchment))[/td][td]1[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Quick and painless.

Also purple ones sell for good silver.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Leather Diary ((Leather Diary))[/td][td]2[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The easiest diary, and the easiest to get rid of. Send these to [user]Mariya[/user] for friendship xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Leather Waterskin ((Leather Waterskin))[/td][td]2[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Definitely try to craft these with mastery bonuses on, ((Mushroom Stew)) and an event bonus if possible. Also do your best to sell these during events, especially with IOTD bonus an ((Shrimp-a-plenty)). Production is almost entirely trhough pets, so will be very slow.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Looking Glass ((Looking Glass))[/td][td]2[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Quick Board/Glass mastery.

Overall pretty cheap to make though.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Shimmer Ring ((Shimmer Ring))[/td][td]2[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]If you've got ((mushroom paste)) it's super quick and easy while opening ((Large Chest 01)). (Good for borgen days, or spinning the wheel).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Steel Wire ((Steel Wire))[/td][td]2[/td][td][[Steelworks]][/td][td]Once you unlock [[Steelworks]] you will start getting passive progress every hour.

Turning them into ((Crossbow)) is a great profit.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sturdy Box ((Sturdy Box))[/td][td]2[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Just needs a lot of wood/boards/planks. You can do this fully from passive production with craftworks.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sturdy Sword ((Sturdy Sword))[/td][td]2[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Using ((mushroom paste)) and ((leather)) from exploring the forest and passive ((steel)) this goes pretty quick, and costs very little.

Mailable for some reason. Send them to [user]LinkJason10j[/user] for fun.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Aquamarine Ring ((Aquamarine Ring))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Needs paste, but pretty cheap and quick overall. Not much else to do in Small Spring though while collecting ((Aquamarine)), so try to make the most of the ((Feathers)) you get while working on this.

It should go very quickly.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Carp ((Carp))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Most people overlook this fish, even though it's pretty easy. That's likely because the other easy Farm Pond fish also come from other locations, and they normally get GMed from those. Send these to [user]Holger[/user] or [user]Thomas[/user].[/td][/tr][tr][td]Carrot ((Carrot))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Don't work on this GM until you have access to ((Breakfast Boost)), whether by cooking it yourself, or trading.

Sells for decent silver too.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Explosive ((Explosive))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The harder of the two ((Black Powder)) masteries, as it uses ((Board)) instead of ((Wood)), but still pretty cheap overall. Save working on this until you can mail them, and send them to [user]Beatrix[/user] for friendship xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Flarefin ((Flarefin))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]The hardest Lake Minerva fish (besides golden). But still not that bad. You should get a good bit of ((Treasure Key)) while GMing this.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Green Jellyfish ((Green Jellyfish))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Medium speed Vast Ocean fish. Much quicker than octopus or squid.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Horn Canteen ((Horn Canteen))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Great to work on if you're exploring Black Rock Canyon for ((Large Chest 02)) or ((Orange Gecko)). If you wait for passive ((Twine)) even GM is pretty cheap.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Jellyfish ((Jellyfish))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Slower fishing mastery, but still very reasonable.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Lemonade ((Lemonade))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Everything :)[/td][td]You will get this over time from crafting your daily fruits into juices, as well as some quests, potentially the T80 perk, and [[Wheel of Borgen]].

I don't think it's necessary to 'actively' work on this.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Puffer ((Puffer))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]A medium speed Emerald Beach mastery. Also a cool emblem that some notable community members use.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Purple Diary ((Purple Diary))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]If you take some time in Highland Hills you can work on both green/purple parchments and diaries. You'll just need to get some extra paste and feathers occassionally to keep up, but it's relatively low effort and fairly quick.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Purple Parchment ((Purple Parchment))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Pretty easy GM. A step on the path to diary GMs while exploring HH.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Red Dye ((Red Dye))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Pretty simple WC mastery. I would turn them into ((Red Shield)) first, then ((Red Trunk)) as you work on oak masteries, then back to ((Red Shield)) for the silver.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Ruby Fish ((Ruby Fish))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]You can get these in both Vast Ocean and Emerald Beach, so you'll get it pretty quick if you're working on other fishing masteries.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Seahorse ((Seahorse))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Slower gm, but relatively easy. Just keep dropping nets in Emerald Beach.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Stingray ((Stingray))[/td][td]3[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Another fishing mastery that can be worked on in both Emerald Beach and Vast Ocean. It's slower than most in either zone, but working on it from both will get it fairly quickly. Send these to [user]Geist[/user] for some friendship xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Blue Dye ((Blue Dye))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]One of the main reasons to explore Misty Forest. You should turn these into ((Blue Purse)) so you can make a lot of silver. If you don't have those unlocked yet, or have already finished, you can knock out ((Fancy Pan Flutes)) pretty wuickly, if you can keep up with the ((Wood)) needed.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Blue Purse ((Blue Purse))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Work on this while doing ((Coin Purse)) and ((Blue Dye)) to make some easy silver.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Crossbow ((Crossbow))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The hardest part of this mastery should be the ((steel wire)), so make sure your steelworks is upgraded a bit to help out. The upside is that these sell for great silver, which you can reinvest.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fish Bones ((Fish Bones))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Low rates, but you can get them from a few zones. Good for cooking or [user]Mummy[/user] friendship xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fluorifish ((Fluorifish))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Medium speed Vast Ocean fish. Much quicker than octopus or squid.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Globber ((Globber))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]A medium speed Lake Tempest/Crystal River fish, and you can suppliment progress a tiny bit with ((Grab Bag 02)) from the Small Cave.[/td][/tr][tr][td]MIAB ((MIAB))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]((large net)) ((large net)) ((large net))[/td][/tr][tr][td]Mussel ((Mussel))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]A very quick Pirate Cove mastery. You'll be fishing there a lot while leaving up and earning silver for tower, so this will come naturally before you know it.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Mystic Ring ((Mystic Ring))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The most annoying ring, because it takes 2 different gems, and 3x ((Mushroom Paste)). Still fairly easy compared to some masteries though.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Potato ((Potato))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Farming, [[Locksmith]][/td][td]Honestly, more people should have this GMed than actually do. It's a fairly fast crop once you have the T10 perk, and you can get a lot from opening ((Grab Bag 01)) from the forest pond. Sacrifice them at the [temple], or send to [user]Holger[/user] for friendship xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Red Shield ((Red Shield))[/td][td]4[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Great for silver![/td][/tr][tr][td]Beet ((Beet))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]You should only really work on this with ((Grape Juice)) and ((Mega Beet Seeds)); either from your [[Strange Onion]] pet, or the [ec]. Make sure to use ((Mushroom Stew)) and it will be pretty quick. Sell, don't void, since they're worth a lot.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Catfish ((Catfish))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Fishing, [[Locksmith]][/td][td]Catfish have a pretty low drop rate from fishing in the Farm Pond. Luckily you can also get them from opening ((Grab Bag 01)), which you get from fishing in the Forest Pond. So don't stress.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Coin Purse ((Coin Purse))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Make sure you turn these into ((Blue Purse)) as much as possible, because the silver is really good.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Feed ((Feed))[/td][td]5[/td][td][[Feed Mill]][/td][td]The biggest drawback is just waiting for it to process. Dump whatever extra crops you might be voiding in, or daily ((Broccoli)) from pets is great too. There is a perk to make the mill process twice as fast, if you want to go for MM it's a good investment, otherwise don't bother.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Flier ((Flier))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Definitely a harder fishing mastery. But at the end of day it's still just making and using more large nets.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Hourglass ((Hourglass))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Another paste mastery, but it's actually not that bad with ((Sand)) from Jundland Desert. I personally would explore Forest for the ((Mushroom Paste)) and ((Wood)) needed.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Jade Charm ((Jade Charm))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Definitely try to craft these with mastery bonuses on, ((Mushroom Stew)) and an event bonus if possible. Also do your best to sell these during events, especially with IOTD bonus an ((Shrimp-a-plenty)). Production is almost entirely trhough pets, so will be very slow.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Large Net ((Large Net))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting, Quests[/td][td]Daily production from [[Raptor Pen]], exploring Forest, and quests are your friend. ((Large Net)) are life.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Magicite ((Magicite))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting, Exploring[/td][td]Starts out pretty slow, but before you know it this will be GMed. EL is a great place to explore and you can work on this via exploring directly, or crafting up ((Prism Shard)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Metal Spool ((Metal Spool))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Easy JD mastery. Ideally you want to turn these into ((Spool of Copper)), but copper is way harder to get than other JD mats.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Octopus ((Octopus))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]A slower Vast Ocean mastery, but at the end of the day it boils down to just using a lot of nets, so not very hard.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Purple Bag ((Purple Bag))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Medium speed mastery, good for silver. Can make even more if you explore forest for the leather and wait for passive ((twine))/((rope)) to come in.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Purple Dye ((Purple Dye))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Needs lots of ((Purple Flower)), but it's easy enough. Use it to make ((Purple Bag)) and ((Belt Drive)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Spoon ((Spoon))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]A bit costly to explore for all the ((bone)) you will need, but luckily, if you wait for passive ((Twine)), the Small Cave holds all the rest of the resources needed, so you can focus exploring there.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sturdy Bow ((Sturdy Bow))[/td][td]5[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Great use for ((oak)) from grinding WC, but it needs ((Mushroom Paste)), ((Twine)), AND ((Steel)), which are all individual sticking points when doing a lot of exploring and crafting. Good for crafting xp and selling for silver as well.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fancy Drum ((Fancy Drum))[/td][td]6[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Uses both ((Leather)) and ((Mushroom Paste)), which are side products of exploring in the Forest, but sadly uses ((Yarn)) too, which you cant make at the same time because you'll need the straw for rope to make nets. I suggest working on this either from trading for the paste/leather, or off an on when not actively exploring forest for nets.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fancy Guitar ((Fancy Guitar))[/td][td]6[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Fairly cheap, but slow, if you wait for passive ((Steel Wire)) from steelworks. If you actively explore for it, you can get it done way quicker, but the cost increases a lot.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fancy Pan Flute ((Fancy Pan Flute))[/td][td]6[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Pretty reasonable mid to late game mastery. Doesn't need crazy resources. Benefits a lot from upgrading sawmill and hayfield.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Flour ((Flour))[/td][td]6[/td][td][[Flour Mill]][/td][td]Each wheat makes 14 flour, so you don't need a crazy amount of wheat to GM this. There's a perk that makes the flour mill process twice as fast. Probably don't buy it unless you're rich or want to MM flour.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Red Berry Pie ((Red Berry Pie))[/td][td]6[/td][td]Cooking[/td][td]Long cook time, which means tasting is really effective. The ((Red Berries)) cost is pretty high, so make sure you're working on other WC masteries when you explore so you're not voiding.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Red Twine ((Red Twine))[/td][td]6[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Medium level craft. Good way to use up ((Red Dye)) from WC after finishing ((Red Shield)), without the heavy ((Steel)) cost of ((Red Trunk)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sunflower ((Sunflower))[/td][td]6[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]With ((Mega Sunflower Seeds)) and ((Grape Juice)) this goes pretty quick, you'll just need to wait for your Onion pet to bring enough seeds. Don't forget to use a ((Mushroom Stew)) for great mastery prgress each harvest.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Wrench ((Wrench))[/td][td]6[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]((Steel)) and ((emberstone)) are used in lots of crafts now. Luskily this one there are no other components. It's pretty realistic to GM these in a few days if you're actively working on them.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Belt Drive ((Belt Drive))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]You will definitely want to be working on these when exploring Jundland Desert. If possible, use them to make ((Engine)), but those can be quite costly so in my opinion it's fine to sell extras if you can't.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Breakfast Boost ((Breakfast Boost))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Cooking[/td][td]This has a shorter cook time, so you won't get as much mastery progress from tasting as longer meals, but it is very cheap to make, so if you're actively working on this mastery it can go rather quickly.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Control Box ((Control Box))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]If you don't have a stockpile of ((Small Screw)), this is the single most stam-intensive craft currently in the game. It's quite costly, but you should definitely be crafting these up into ((Engine)) as you go.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Corn ((Corn))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Farming, [[Locksmith]][/td][td]You will naturally master this just trying to do quests. There are plenty of uses for corn, between cooking, [[rfc]], and ((corn oil)), so if you want to knock it out as a GM, you can fish in Pirate's Cove and open the ((Large chest 03)) to help out.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Giant Squid ((Giant Squid))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Slow Vast Ocean GM... But at the end of the day it's still just tossing nets, so low effort.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Leek ((Leek))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]The slowest growing mailable crop. Because of that it's easy to avoid growing these and just buy. I'd recommend growing them yourself though. They have a decent grow length where you can plant them, do a few things, and come back and reset. Also useful for cooking.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Onion ((Onion))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]You will need a lot of these for cooking, but it still takes a while to GM them.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Salt ((Salt))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Crafting, [[Locksmith]][/td][td]Slower mastery to start, but you'll need a bunch for quests and cooking. At some point you may start voiding it if you're using ((Large Chest 03)) to get ((Corn)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Tomato ((Tomato))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]See note for leeks.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Wizard Hat ((Wizard Hat))[/td][td]7[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Requires just enough ((purple flower)) and ((leather)) to be annoying. It's really not a hard mastery, just inconvenient.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Apple Cider ((Apple Cider))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Crafting, Quests[/td][td]Fairly easy to master, but GM will take some time. You also get a good amount from quests and some from pets over time. If you care about GM, use ((Mushroom Stew)) when claiming large amounts from quests.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Arnold Palmer ((Arnold Palmer))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Crafting, Quests[/td][td]You will always want to turn your lemonade into AP, but this will probably take a long time to GM. If you care about GM on this, make sure you're using ((Mushroom Stew)) for quests that reward more than a few hundred.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Broccoli ((Broccoli))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Long enough that you don't want to be growing it all day, but not quite long enough to justify using ((Grape Juice)) on it regularly in my opinion, unless you need it for quests. Also brought by 3 pets, which is nice.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Cabbage ((Cabbage))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]See the notes on ((Broccoli)) above, but this time it's brought by 4 pets instead. Not that that helps much for mastery. You need more than 40k for quests, which gets a good chunk of the GM out of the way.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Concord Grape Pie ((Concord Grape Pie))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Cooking[/td][td]Long cook time, which means you get mastery progress quickly from actions. Also good for cooking xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Gold Cucumber ((Gold Cucumber))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming, [[Locksmith]][/td][td]Grown from ((Gold Cucumber Seeds)), if you have them, or a rare chance from ((Cucumber Seeds)). Also you can get these from ((Grab Bag 01)) which is from fishing at the Forest Pond. This is the easiest gold crop because of this.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Hops ((Hops))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]It grows pretty quick after you unlock the first [[Tower]] artifact, but there's not much to do with it after you've grown it. You can send it to [user]Beatrix[/user], [user]George[/user], or [user]Vincent[/user] for some friendship xp.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Kill Switch ((Kill Switch))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The cheapest ((Engine)) component, if that counts for anything. Easy enough you shouldn't worry too much about crafting these up and selling if you just want to focus GM and not spend your entire life savings and time making engines.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Machine Press ((Machine Press))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]One of the friendlier JD crafts. You'll need lots for all the ((Corn Oil)) needed for other masteries.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Pine Tree ((Pine Tree))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Slow enough crop that you shouldn't feel bad about using ((Grape Juice)) on them. In the past they've been needed a lot for the December event (Crafting ((Christmas Tree)) and ((Holiday Wreath)) ) and the winter 'season' (Small chance of ((Frozen Pine)) when harvesting), so if that time of year is coming up, hold off on GM for then.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Radish ((Radish))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Fast enough that using ((grape Juice)) or cookies doesn't make sense, but slow enough that GM will take a few weeks probably.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Rice ((Rice))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Only viable way to work on this is daily ((Grape Juice)). Make sure you have ((Mushroom Stew)) active, and maybe even some cookies. Sell extras to avoid voiding, or you can use a bit in cooking ( ((Shrimp-a-Plenty)) ).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Steel Plate ((Steel Plate))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Needs ((emberstone)) and ((Small bolt)), neither of which is really fun to get. But more reaosnable number than some other things. Plenty of items to craft these up into while working on GM.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Watermelon ((Watermelon))[/td][td]8[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Watermelon is the fastest non-tradable crop. If you buckle down and work on GM it will still take a while, but you can stock up on some ((Piece of Heart)) in the process. If you're going to void, [[Feed Mill]] or [temple] are good places to send your extras.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Bone Broth ((Bone Broth))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Cooking, [[Borgen Shop]][/td][td]Bone Broth is technically the hardest &quot;Meal&quot; to master/GM because you get almost no mastery progress from tasting. It's also the easiest, because it has been offered at Borgen's a few times, but you are always limited on how much you can buy based on inventory cap. It is not sellable, so you have to use it to cook other recipes to make space.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Butter ((Butter))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Relies on daily ((Milk)) production, which is limited by inventory and cow levels. Can go quicker if you trade for milk, but will probably still take a very long time.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Canoe ((Canoe))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The amount of ((Oak)) needed for these is insane. They also need a good amount of ((Mushroom Paste)) which can get annoying fast. Most people that have GMed these just did it because they were bored, genuinely. Plus side is, you'll get loads of ((Raptor Egg)) while working on it.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Cat's Meow ((Cat's Meow))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Cooking[/td][td]Lower-cook time meal, which means tasting gives less mastery, but relatively cheap. Gm will take a long time.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Cooking Pot ((Cooking Pot))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Requires a ton of ((Emberstone)). Going for mastery on this is reasonable, but GM is just a flex goal at this point, in my opinion.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Corn Oil ((Corn Oil))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The main drawback on with this is the high ((corn)) cost. Mastery is expensive, but you can get it done in a reasonable time. GM is out of the question in my opinion.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Cotton ((Cotton))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Cotton has a long enough growth time that it's no fun at all to grow. Luskily you don't really need it a ton, and 2 pets bring it. You'll probably master it while working on quests, but GM will be a long journey.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Crab Claw ((Crab Claw))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Fishing, Pets[/td][td]You will probably get regular mastery for this naturally while working on quests and other GMs, but GM will require a lot of resources and/or time. Macaw brings these.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Energy Coil ((Energy Coil))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]A lot goes into this craft, but the main limiting factor is probably going to be ((Transistor)) as you go. Mastery will take a while, GM will take forever.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fancy Chair ((Fancy Chair))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]THe hardest part of this is the ((Cotton)). At 6 per chair you will need a significant amount. I would recommend using daily grape juice for the cotton, along with any crop multiplying meals on ((Mega Cotton Seeds)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fancy Table ((Fancy Table))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Requires both ((Corn oil)) and ((Steel Vise)), as well as tons of ((Oak)). The only upside is the sell price.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Green Cloak ((Green Cloak))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting, [[Locksmith]][/td][td]Annoying to GM, because it takes ((Cotton)) to craft. But with all of the ((Grape Juice)) perks and the T150 artifact you can grow quite a bit in a day and get some solid progress. You can also get them via ((Mystical Chest 02)) from fishing in Pirate's Cove.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Iced Tea ((Iced Tea))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Pretty slow mastery/GM. You really shouldn't need a lot of tea in your daily play, so selling is probably okay. Make sure you're working on other CPR masteries like ((Lemon Quartz Ring)) and something with ((Glass Orb)) so you're not wasting resources.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Neigh ((Neigh))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Cooking[/td][td]GM will taek a long time, but this is one of the cheaper meals to make. It's mostly crops that can be grown instantly with ((Breakfast Boost)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Pear Grease ((Pear Grease))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Like most JD crafts, this will take a while. It's not very complex, it just needs lots of exploring in Jundland for all the ((prickly pear)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Pie Pan ((Pie Pan))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Requires ((Moonstone)), which will take a while. Over 30k are needed for quests, which is a good chunk of mastery.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Potato Battery ((Potato Battery))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The biggest hold up is exploring JD for ((copper wire)) to make ((spool of copper)). You can grow the potatoes or fish for them (via ((Grab bag 01)) ) in the Forest Pond. You'll need 30k of these for the COI questline, so plan accordingly.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Pumpkin ((Pumpkin))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]Honestly this rating is partially just based on the fact that you don't really ever need a large amount of pumpkins for anything. They have a long enough grow time that ((Grape Juice)) makes sense to grow them, but it would only be for mastery. Most other crops are needed more for quests or crafting, or season events.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Red Trunk ((Red Trunk))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Uses a good bit of resources, but still fairly easy if you wait for passive ((Steel)). Sells for okay silver, but in general ((Red shield)) is better profit for mostly the same materials.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Sea Pincher Special ((Sea Pincher Special))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Cooking[/td][td]Longer cook time, so you will get more mastery per taste. The biggest draw back is the ((Honey)) needed to cook it.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Seaweed ((Seaweed))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Fishing[/td][td]Very slow, but easier than the likes of ((Sea Dragon)) or ((Crab Claw)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Wheat ((Wheat))[/td][td]9[/td][td]Farming[/td][td]There isn't much point to growing a lot of wheat other than ((flour)) and a few quests. If you've already done longer crops it makes sense to use some ((Grape Juice)) on it.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Acorn Butter ((Acorn Butter))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Good way to use up ((Acorn)), but it needs so many that GM will take a long long time. Always make sure you're tossing them here instead of voiding though.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Amber Cane ((Amber Cane))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Requires ((Amber)), which is a Super Rare, and costly to explore for. You get it from your Lemur at level 6, but not enough to go for GM, or even mastery really.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Bouquet of Flowers ((Bouquet of Flowers))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]So far, the seeds for flowers are quite limited. Even using all cookies it requires many seeds to get mastery, and a crazy amount for GM.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Cabbage Stew ((Cabbage Stew))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Cooking[/td][td]Very high resource cost (it's mostly ((Cabbage)), which take forever to grow).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Compass ((Compass))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The only way to craft ((Compass)) is to toss them into the [[Wishing Well]], then recraft with the ((Magna Core)) you get back. It's very expensive, as each costs 4x ((Small Screw)) and your free tosses into the well are limited. It's is somewhat reasonable (although expensive) to master over a long period of time. GM is out of the question.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Engine ((Engine))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]The amount of stamina and mental drain to craft these will drive you mad. Many different components, with many different zones necessary. The biggest cost is all of the ((small screw)) and ((small spring)) you will end up needing.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Flying Machine ((Flying machine))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]One of the most expensive crafts in the game, even moreso than ((engine)).[/td][/tr][tr][td]Flywheel ((Flywheel))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]((Small Screw)) are quite limited and/or costly, so GM will be a long road. Mastery is still very rough, but doable with time. Steelworks also occassionally produces these.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Frost Shield ((Frost Shield))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Requires ((Frost Snapper Shell)), which is an SR from Glacier Lake, or the [[Spotted Seal]] pet. Not practical to work on GM, or even mastery really.[/td][/tr][tr][td]Fruit Punch ((Fruit Punch))[/td][td]10[/td][td]Crafting[/td][td]Mastery and GM are both very expensive, and very not necessary.
