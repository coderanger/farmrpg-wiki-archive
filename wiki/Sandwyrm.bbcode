[line]When you manually explore Jundland Desert, here is a chance that a sandwyrm will appear and steal some of your stamina (10% of your total, with a max of 10k stolen). To avoid losing stamina, and be able to use arnold palmers and apple cider, you must craft ((Y73841 Detector)). See [[Rare Items And Locked Locations]] for more info.
