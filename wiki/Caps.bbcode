A stated in the [COC], messages with all or mostly capital letters are not allowed. This is up to mod discression. The reason for this is that we don't want annoying people saying &quot;CAN I HAVE STONE PLZ!?!!?&quot; or &quot;WHY DID NO ONE ANSWER MY QUESTION?!?&quot; spamming chat.



This is also a repository of library pages... of a certain kind. 

[[Tower construction]]
[[the tower spoiler]]
[[capybara]] (including haiku in comments!)
[[tower keys]] have been found?
[[Tower entry]] commences!
If you're actually interested in the tower, click [[tower]]. The rest are just for fun. 

Now with more turtles!
