[item]When you get to level 99 in exploring, crafting, fishing and farming (commonly referred to 4x99), a new feature is unlocked at the bottom of your [EC] called &quot;XP CONVERSION&quot;.[/item]
[item]Once a day, you can do ONE of the following exchanges:
[list][item]100 million of your extra XP into 100 million silver.[/item][item]Some XP for some ((grab bag 07))[/item][item]Some XP for some ((ancience coin))[/item][/list]
[item]You cannot drop below 2 billion xp so you won't loose any levels.[/item]
[item]It takes more XP from whichever skill has the most XP. So if fishing is at 15 billion and exploring is only 2.1 billion, most of the XP will be taken from fishing[/item]
[item]There are two [[Perks]] that effect XP conversion. Conversation Skills I and Conversation Skills II. Each one allows you to convert an extra 100 million xp per day. So with both of the perks, you can convert 300 million xp. [b]These perks have no use before 4x99![/b][/item]
