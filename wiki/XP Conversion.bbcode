[item]When you get to level 99 in exploring, crafting, fishing and crafting (commonly referred to 99x4), a new feature is unlocked at the bottom of your [EC] called &quot;XP CONVERSION&quot;.[/item]

[item]Once a day, you can exchange 100 million of your extra XP into 100 million silver.[/item]

You cannot drop below 2 billion xp so you won't loose any levels. 

It takes more XP from whichever skill has the most XP. So if fishing is at 15 billion and exploring is only 2.1 billion, most of the XP will be taken from fishing
