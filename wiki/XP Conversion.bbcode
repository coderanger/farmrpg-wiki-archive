[item]When you get to level 99 in exploring, crafting, fishing and farming (commonly referred to 4x99), a new feature is unlocked at the bottom of your [EC] called &quot;XP CONVERSION&quot;.[/item]
[item]Once a day, you can do ONE of the following exchanges:[/item][list][item]100 million of your extra XP into 100 million silver[/item][item]100 million XP for 5 Grab Bag 07 ((grab bag 07)) (The one with gold fish)[/item][item]100 million XP for 100 Ancient Coins ((ancient coin))[/item][/list]
[item]You cannot drop below 2 billion xp so you won't loose any levels.[/item]
[item]It takes more XP from whichever skill has the most XP. So if fishing is at 15 billion and exploring is only 2.1 billion, most of the XP will be taken from fishing[/item]
[center][b]These perks have no use before 4x99![/b][/center]
[item]There are 3 [[Perks]] that effect XP conversion. Conversation Skills I, II and III. Each one allows you to convert an extra 100 million xp per day. So with all 3 of the perks, you can convert 400 million xp. You can only convert for one thing. Either 400 million for Coins, 400 million for grab bags or 400 million for silver[/item]
