WORK IN PROGRESS
These are some common things that are suggested to throw into the [[Wishing Well]] at various levels.


1. Before sawmill: Ask in giveaways for Gold Drum ((gold drum)), throw into wishing well for sturdy bows and sell them

2. You need one of each [[runestones]] 1-10, check [[WWW]] for how to get each one

3. You need 64 Gold Leaves for an important quest. See [[WWW]] for how to get them.

4. You need: Geckos and spiked shells, throw crab claws (from macaw) and salt

5. Nothing is super important after you finish tower. Some people like to go for unique items only found in the WW like Teapot or Small Flute. Others go for more geckos and spiked shells, for a few quests and just in case
