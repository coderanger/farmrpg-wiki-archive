[color=deepskyblue][b]What is a Borgen Buck?[/b][/color][s]((Borgen Buck)) is a new currency item that you get by spending [[Ancient coins]] over time. You will get 1 buck per 10000 Ancient Coins that you spend, between the [[Wheel of Borgen]], [[Borgen Shop]], or [[The Vault]].[/s]

[color=deepskyblue][b]How do I get a Borgen Buck?[/b][/color][s]You get ((Borgen Buck)) by spending ((Ancient Coin)) at the wheel, vault, or Borgen's Camp (on Wednesdays). There is now a tracker for how much total AC you spend between these locations, and every 10000 coins you spend will reward you with one ((Borgen Buck)). If you're at 9999 coins towards a buck and spend 100, you will get the buck and reset to 99 progress towards the next one.[/s]

[color=deepskyblue][b]What do I do with a Borgen Buck?[/b][/color][s]For right now, nothing. Feel free to start stocking up but they can’t be used for anything quite yet.

From [update]: “The new Borgen Buck currency will unlock a new shop in May that Borgen runs with some very highly sought after items, if you have enough bucks...”[/s]

[color=deepskyblue][b]I've spent millions of AC before, will I get Borgen Bucks for those?[/b][/color][s]No. Only newly spent ((Ancient Coin)) will progress you toward getting ((Borgen Buck)). If they were added retroactively, it would ruin the novelty and balance of the currency.[/s]
