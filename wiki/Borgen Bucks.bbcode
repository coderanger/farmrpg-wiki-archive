[color=deepskyblue][b]What is a Borgen Buck?[/b][/color][s]((Borgen Buck)) is a currency item that you get by spending [[Ancient coins]] over time. You will get 1 buck per 10000 Ancient Coins that you spend in either the [[Wheel of Borgen]], [[Borgen Shop]], or [[The Vault]].

As you claim mega masteries (see [[Item Mastery]]), the ancient coins you're required to spend to earn Bucks will decrease. Refer to Luna's Sheets on [[Community Guides]] for a table.[/s]

[color=deepskyblue][b]How do I get a Borgen Buck?[/b][/color][s]You get ((Borgen Buck)) by spending ((Ancient Coin)) at the wheel, vault, or Borgen's Camp (on Wednesdays). There is a tracker for how much total AC you spend between these locations, and every 10000 coins you spend will reward you with one ((Borgen Buck)). If you're at 9999 coins towards a buck and spend 100, you will get the buck and reset to 99 progress towards the next one. 

Collecting a mega-mastery reward will give a small decrease to the amount of AC you will need to spend to get a buck. This decrease will be shown on the tracker at these locations.

You can also get them from a few other places, such as quests, friendship rewards, the locksmith, or the temple. Keep an eye out![/s]
