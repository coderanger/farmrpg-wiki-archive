Spoilers!
[s]Need ((R.O.A.S.)) or ((Egyptian necklace)) ? The text of the quest lines asking for these items are riddles, the answers to which are [[mailbox passwords]]. That page has some of them, others are still being solved. Feel free to work on solving them yourself, or just keep checking the mbpw page. You do NOT have to grind for these items or worry about obtaining them outside of solving the riddles/using the passwords.

Need a ((Jack-o-key)) to open the Haunted House? Finish the &quot;Letâ€™s Do the Time Warp&quot; quest line.
