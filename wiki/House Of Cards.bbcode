[item]The House of Cards has two parts: Daily Card Combos and Buddyjack[/item]
[center][b][size=16]Daily Card Combos:[/size][/b][/center]
[item]Each day you will be presented with a combination of cards you can play to earn a reward. The cards are played and turned in when you do this. The rewards are pretty good, including some things found nowhere else in the game. A new combo will appear at reset.[/item]
[item][url=https://buddy.farm/cards/]https://buddy.farm/cards/[/url] has the card combos and rewards.[/item]
[center][b][size=16]Buddyjack:[/size][/b][/center]
[item]A game you can play daily. Buddyjack is like 21, but simpler. For each game, the dealer (Buddy) has a score and you need to beat his score without going over 21. You can 'hit me' or 'stay' to play. If you win, you get a random card (Clubs, Hearts, Spades, Diamonds or Joker). If you get a 21 and win, you get an extra card reward. If you tie the dealer, you get a consolation prize. You can play Buddyjack 3 times per day by default.[/item]
[item]2 perks are available to buy. &quot;Ace Up the Sleeve&quot; increases your chances of beating Buddy slightly. &quot;High Roller&quot; allows you to have +1 extra Buddyjack game daily[/item]
