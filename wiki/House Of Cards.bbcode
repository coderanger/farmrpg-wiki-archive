The House of Cards has two parts: Daily Card Combos and Buddyjack

[center][b][size=16]Daily Card Combos:[/size][/b][/center]
[item]Each day you will be presented with a combination of playing cards, ( ((hearts)), ((diamonds)), ((clubs)), ((spades)) and ((joker)) ) which you can play (trade) to earn a reward. The cards are played and turned in from your inventory when you do this. The rewards are pretty good, including some things found nowhere else in the game. A new combo will appear at reset. The daily combo is not the same for all players.[/item][item]If you are missing a required card, but have a Joker, it will be used instead.[/item]

[item]A game you can play daily. Buddyjack is like the card game &quot;21&quot;, but simpler. For each game, the dealer ([user]Buddy[/user]) has a score and you need to beat his score without going over 21. You can 'hit me' or 'stay' to play. If you win, you get a random card (Clubs, Hearts, Spades, Diamonds or Joker). If you get a 21 and win, you get an extra card as a reward. If you tie with the dealer, you get a consolation prize. You can play Buddyjack 3 times per day by default.[/item]
