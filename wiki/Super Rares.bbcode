These items have a very low drop rate.  Some are guesstimated to be 1 in 50,000 or lower!  Quite exciting to find them all!

Note: Some items, such as ((Buddy Doll)), are now categorized as &quot;Very Rare&quot; which basiclaly means the same thing as super rare but it makes it so Firestream can have those items in a seperate location on profiles.

Click &quot;Spoiler&quot; to see where to find them. Also if you find it, probably [[dont sell it]].
