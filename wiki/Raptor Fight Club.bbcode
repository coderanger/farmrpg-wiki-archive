-You may now only use [b]3[/b] raptors maximum. 4 if you have the [[Perks]]

- Every raptor has different stats.  Search for your best ones!

- You can stop a raptor from fighting by clicking the status bar on the raptor stat page. This allows you to swap out new raptors while still having the ability to have them fight later.
Note: The status bar either says &quot;fighting&quot; &quot;recovering&quot; or &quot;exhausted&quot;

- In RFC, Sturdy Swords and Sturdy Shields can be given to your raptors to give them a chance in each battle for an attack or defense boost. There is a chance the Sword or Shield breaks after use. The attack/defense buff effect sticks for the remainder of that battle even if the item breaks.

- You can visit the soap shop by tapping on a fighting raptor and clicking &quot;Visit Soap Shop&quot; at the top

- You can 'retire' raptors that have a power level of at least 38 by going to a raptor and clicking the button underneath the fight log. You get raptor claws in return based on their power (1 claw per 25 power, with rounding) but they are permanently removed, can no longer fight, and lose all items they were holding.

- Retiring raptors has no effect on your antler/kebob gains.
