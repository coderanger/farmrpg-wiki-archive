You need to unlock [[Raptor Pen]] first. Raptor Fight Club, (RFC), is a battle system for your Raptors once they reach level 10. Just go to a level 10 Raptor, tap your raptor and tap the 'Go to Raptor Fight Club' button.

- You may have 3 raptors fighting in RFC at one time. 4 if you have the correct perk. [[Perks]]

- Every raptor has different stats.  Search for your best ones! 2 is the lowest a stat can have and 6 is the highest by default. Stats can be increased by giving a ((raptor claw)) to a raptor and it increases a random stat or HP.

- You can stop a raptor from fighting by clicking the status bar on the raptor stat page. This allows you to swap out new raptors while still having the ability to have them fight later.
Note: The status bar either says &quot;fighting&quot; &quot;recovering&quot; or &quot;exhausted&quot;

- In RFC, Sturdy Swords and Sturdy Shields as well as other items can be given to your raptors to give them boosts. The sword and shield give a chance in each battle for an attack or defense boost. There is a chance the Sword or Shield breaks after use. The attack/defense buff effect sticks for the remainder of that battle even if the item breaks.

- Raptors earn 1 ((soap)) for every win. You can visit the [soap] by tapping on a fighting raptor and clicking &quot;Visit Soap Shop&quot; at the top. It will unlock once you have a raptor hit 10 wins. If it still doesn't show up, click the refresh button on the home page.

- You can 'retire' raptors that have a power level of at least 38 by going to a raptor and clicking the button underneath the fight log. You get raptor claws in return based on their power (1 claw per 25 power, with rounding) but they are permanently removed, can no longer fight, and lose all items they were holding.

- Having raptors fight, not fight or being retired has no effect on your antler/kebob gains.
