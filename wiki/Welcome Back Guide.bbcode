Guide written by [user]Nicho[/user] and last updated on February 25, 2024.
If there is a major update that is not featured here, message [user]Nicho[/user] about having it added.[/center]

This guide is meant to serve as a chronological index of major updates and changes to Farm RPG to assist returning players. Simply find the month you last played and begin reading from there to the bottom. Alpha and Beta only updates have been excluded for the sake of simplicity.

The following links are also worth checking as additions are fairly common to these parts of Farm RPG:

[center][Achievements] | [gallery] | [[Artifacts]] | [[Building Upgrades]] | [coc] | [[Crop Drops]] | [supply] | [mailboxes] | [[Meals]] | [school] | [[Super Rares]][/center]
Furthermore, check your Help Needed, Workshop, Perks, and Mastery progress screens for new things as well. Help requests marked with a Main Quest star will help you progress to new areas or unlock additional features.
