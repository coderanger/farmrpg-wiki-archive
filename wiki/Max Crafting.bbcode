Max crafting is a consequence of how Resource Saver perks work when hitting your inventory cap. Normally, Resource Saver gives you bonus crafts. For example, with RS 1+2, crafting 100 items gives you ~125. If you only had 100 space left to your inventory cap though, it can't give you 25 extra items so it instead returns ~25 items worth of materials back to you. This means you get 100 items for the cost of ~75, which is equivalent to ~33% bonus crafts instead of the expected 25%. At T90 this makes the ~43% bonus crafts turn into ~75% bonus crafts. Optimizing max crafting is finicky because you need to constantly use or sell items in small quantities, craft small quantities, and repeat, so pre-T90 the effort is likely not worth the limited payoff. Post-T90 it is definitely worth considering at least for high value crafts like fruit juices and nets. If you want to pursue max crafting it is easiest to do the largest batch size possible for the craft you are working on, which varies based on item. Leather takes 2 Hide, so you can max craft batches up to 50% your inventory size. Large Nets take 25 nets/rings so you can max craft batches only up to 4% your inventory size.
