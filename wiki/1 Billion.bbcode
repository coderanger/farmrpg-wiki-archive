[size=16]Congratulations! You have made your first BILLION SILVER and wonder what to do with it![/size]

[b]Here are what others before you have considered:[/b]

[item]It is suggested to read the [[Level 5 Owl]] page before upgrading the owl to level 6[/item]
[item]More orchard trees- if your orchard IS NOT max size for your inventory, a bigger orchard will give you more bang for your buck than anything else! Bigger orchard will help find all the items you need for the grindy tasks, can be used to get items for crafting silver and mastery gold, can be used to make nets and fish for silver.  Make sure you consider FORESTER perks when calculating max orchard vs inventory size.  See [[Orchard]] for max values at each perk level.[/item]
[item]MORE inventory per day at storehouse - spending 1 billion for another +2 inventory space per day may sound small, but it’s massive!  60 more FREE inventory space per month.  More inventory space is EVERYTHING in this game [[Inventory Growth]][/item]
[item]If it only takes a few days to get another billion, it is probably worth getting the macaw first. A lvl 6 Macaw brings an average of 12 large nets a day which is about 42-50 million silver a day if used at large island. It helps a lot with unlocking Pirates Cove so for most people, this is their first lvl 6 pet. If you are going quickly though the game, a lvl 6 Green Python is a good idea for the skull coins. See [[Pet Guide]] for more info and recommendations[/item]
[item]1B crop row: It gives you 1 billion [[Farming]] experience and more silver and xp daily from using Grape Juice on sunflower/beets/rice. If you are close to an event with bonus XP, buying the crop row then gives nice boost of XP.[/item]
[item]Kitchen: It gives you 500 million xp and unlocks the [[Cooking]] skill. Not really something that has to be rushed but it gives some nice bonuses and is great in the long term.[/item]
[item]Check all your production buildings and be sure none are lagging behind[/item]

And once you’ve gotten there, there’s [[10 Billion]]!
