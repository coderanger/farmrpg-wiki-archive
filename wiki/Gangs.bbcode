What are gangs (and clubs, alliances or empires)? Just the emblems you choose to use!

[b]Please Note:[/b] These are just for fun, and having nothing to do with anything actually in the game, or actual group, or competition, other than having fun with what emblem you may pick for your name in chat. 

How to join a gang:[s]Pick an icon in Main Menu / My Settings.  This is now your gang. 
Everyone with the same icon is your gang member. 
Represent each other, and have some fun![/s]
