Guess any combination of the numbers: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
Yellow box means the number is in the solution somewhere, just not that space.
Blue box means the number is in that location in the solution. 
Duplicate numbers can be confusing!  If you guess 9999, as in the image below, and it shows blue, yellow, blue, yellow.  This means the yellows are not 9.

So, in the above, I know that 5 is in my second location. 
I also know that the numbers 1,2,3,4,6,7,8 are not in the solution because they are gray. 
I have not guessed 0 at all. [b] Donâ€™t forget to try the number 0![/b]
My next guess in this puzzle would be 9590, since I also know 5 is not in the last space from the line above. [/list]

[color=orchid]Common Strategy[/color][s]
Enter 1234
Enter 5678
This will tell you 8 of the 10 numbers, and their positions. 
This leaves 0 and 9 to figure out.
