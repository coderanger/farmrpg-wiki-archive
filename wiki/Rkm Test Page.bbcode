Rkm’s Pet Guide
(TLDR at the end)

This guide is the author's opinion, please feel free to send me a message in game or on discord if you have any questions or comments
Note: No pets will give you a return on your investment quickly. But they're very useful for passive, consistent silver and items needed for quests

Please read the first part of the &quot;Pet shop&quot; library page before reading this guide and refer to it for the drops and unlock requirements.
Spoilers: This is full of spoilers, read at your own risk

1. Your first pets: The Cat, Dog and Squirrel bring in a few nice items but nothing too important. Level them up when you have some spare silver but there is no hurry.

2. After storehouse: Unlock and get the Owl to level 3 (2,100,000 silver) right after getting the storehouse. The reason is Honey. Honey is impossible to get quickly and you will need a lot for endgame quests. Get Owl to level 5 as soon as it is reasonable to do so. Lvl 5 is going to bring in the most honey, 15 a day. But leave it there! Level 6, will bring in slightly less honey, 12 a day, which makes a difference over time.

3. What about the other pets? Pets will unlock over time, none are important for quite awhile, unlock and upgrade them when it is cheap for you to do so.

Hedgehog: It brings in some nice crops for the feed mill. Specifically broccoli. You should be able to keep your mill topped off with just hedgehog broccoli. Also brings in cheese that you will need for later quests. No need to go past lvl 4 for now

Rock: Its only redeeming features is that it is cute and it brings in Jade and Unpolished Jade, which is otherwise hard to get. Do not prioritize

Penguin: Brings in lots of fish? The only thing I found it useful for is a quest that needed Octopus and Giant Squid. Quite useless all around. Don’t bother getting it to lvl 5 or 6
