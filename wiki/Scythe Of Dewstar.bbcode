[center]The ((scythe of dewstar)) is the artifact you get from tower level 250. [[Artifacts]][/center]
[item]It gives you a varied amount of equal or lower grow time crops in addition to whatever you were growing[/item][item]For example, if you have 40 farm plots and you harvest, you get your 40 wheat + whatever you get from double crop perks as normal. However you also get a random selection of other equal or lower crops such as peppers, tomatoes, radishes etc...[/item][item]The number of bunus crops you get is equal to the number of farm plots you have. In that example, I would get 40 bonus crops[/item][d=Screenshot of a harvest log]
This is a screenshot of a harvest log from Rkm13 who had 48 farm plots at the time

You also do not get XP from bonus crops [[XP Mechanics]]. Harvesting mega seeds gives the same bonus crops as if you had harvested the non mega version[/item][item]If you harvest peppers, your bonus crops are all peppers[/item][item]If tou plant gold seeds, your bonus crops are not gold[/item]
