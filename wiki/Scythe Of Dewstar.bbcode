[center]The Scythe Of Dewstar ((scythe of dewstar)) is the artifact you get from tower level 250. [[Artifacts]][/center]
[item]When harvesting, you get one bonus crop per farm plot that you have. These bonus crops are equal or lesser grow time than what you are harvesting[/item][item]For example, if you have 40 farm plots and you harvest wheat, you get your 40 wheat + whatever you get from double crop perks as normal. However you also get a random selection of other equal or lower crops such as peppers, tomatoes, radishes etc...[/item][item]The number of bonus crops you get is equal to the number of farm plots you have. In that example, I would get 40 bonus crops[/item][d=Screenshot of a harvest log]
This is a screenshot of a harvest log from Rkm13 who had 48 farm plots at the time

You also do not get XP from bonus crops [[XP Mechanics]]. Harvesting mega seeds gives the same bonus crops as if you had harvested the non mega version[/item][item]If you harvest peppers, your bonus crops are all peppers[/item][item]If you plant gold seeds, your bonus crops are not gold[/item][item]Bonus crops do not count towards harvest crops chore count[/item]
