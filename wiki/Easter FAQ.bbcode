[size=20][color=#AD70D4][b]How does the egg hunt event work?[/b][/color][/size]
[s]During the month of April, you can find eggs hidden around Redbrook. These can be used to complete seasonal requests. All eggs are tradable. In years past, eggs were available from various exploration zones, seasonal crop drops, [comm] goals, and limited time quests.

Occasionally, Eggs will be available in Exploring zones. This will be indicated by an EGG! notice on the Go Exploring section on Home, as well as [color=orange]An usual item is dropping here![/color] alert on the specific Exploring zone. The EGG! events last for 10 minutes.

[b]If you can't find a particular egg just yet, don't worry. Eggs and ways to obtain them have been added in as the month progresses in years past.[/b][/s]
[size=20][color=#AD70D4][b]Where can I find egg ___?[/b][/color][/size]
[s]These tables are currently incomplete and will be updated as the event progresses. A blank cell indicates no known dedicated source yet. You may also want to check [bf] and [[Easter 2023]]. Eggs 01-12 can all be obtained randomly from ((egg basket)) Egg Basket, and the Magical Eggs can all be obtained randomly from ((magical egg basket)) Magical Egg Basket. The eggs are also tradeable so you can try giveaways or trade chat as well.
