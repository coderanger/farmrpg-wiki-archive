Apple Cider and Exploring Effectiveness

For every point added to exploring effectiveness, you explore 12.5 more times when using apple cider. (This number is rounded)

So if you are exploring 24 times per click in an area and you pay the fee to increase it your exploring effectiveness, (with both Sprint Shoes I and II perks) you will now get 28 explores per click.  This brings the extra explores you get with cider from 300 to 350 (12.5 x 4 = 50). 

The base number of explores is 1000 so you add thatnow you can add either 1000 or 1250 to that for your new total depending on whether or not you have the Cinnamon Sticks perk.
