Apple Cider and Exploring Effectiveness

For every point of stam added to exploring effectiveness, you use 12.5 more stam when using apple cider.

So if you are getting 24 stam per click in an area and you pay the fee to increase it (with both Sprint Shoes I and II) it will now be 28 stam per click.  This brings the extra amount of stam used by cider from 300 to 350 (12.5 x 4 = 50), now you can add either 1000 or 1250 to that for your new total depending on whether or not you have the Cinnamon Sticks perk.
