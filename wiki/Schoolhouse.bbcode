The Schoolhouse will provide quizzes on a regular basis that give rewards based on your score. You can retake a quiz once a day if you don't get 100%. To clarify here, if you don't get 100%, you'll have to wait until the next Server Reset to retake it. This allows you to retake the quizzes once a day.
