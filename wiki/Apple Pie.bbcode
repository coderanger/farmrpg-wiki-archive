The apple pie ((apple pie)) increases your stamina limit permanently by 10 per exploring level and 1 per tower level. 

The max amount that it can currently add is 1,189 stamina if you are at Tower Level 199.

Multiply your max stamina by 8 to calculate the amount of stamina gained every day at your Farmhouse. The apple pie at T199 gives 9,512 extra stamina each day. See [[Farmhouse]] for more info about how that works.
