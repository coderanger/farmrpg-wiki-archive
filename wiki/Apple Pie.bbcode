You use an apple pie by going to your Farmhouse

The apple pie ((apple pie)) increases your max stamina limit permanently by 10 per exploring level and 1 per tower level.

To be clear, this does not increase the +1 (or +2 if you have the perk) daily increase. It gives a one time boost to your max stamina.

The highest it can boost your max stamina is +1,240 if you are at Tower Level 250.

Multiply your max stamina by 8 to calculate the amount of stamina gained every day at your Farmhouse. The apple pie at T199 gives 9,512 extra stamina each day. See [[Farmhouse]] for more info about how that works.

Apple pies can be obtained in the following ways:
1. ((apple basket)) Apple Basket, the September 2023 starter pack.
2. Quests: PAMRATS X (T199), Masks Aren’t Scary, Kids III (T199 October seasonal), It’s Beginning To Look A Lot Like Warfare XV (T199 January seasonal).
3. Trade chat.
