This includes sending items to NPCs for friendship. You may need lots of rarer items later, and if you have limited access, you won't have enough time to get an appropriate amount back.[/color] 

General rule of thumb, make sure you &quot;lock&quot; items you do not want to sell. Some unique or super rare items will lock automatically.[line][color=#52B2BF]•if it's one of the [b][[runestones]][/b] or [b][[super rares]] [/b]don't sell it. *[size=10]Once you have pets and sphere production, keep one of each in storehouse[/size][/color]
