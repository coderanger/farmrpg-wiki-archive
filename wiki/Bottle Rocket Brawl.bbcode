[list][item]To join in, make sure you have your safety goggles ((safety goggles)) handy (not in your storehouse)! You can get these from the starter pack ((Beatrix's Booming Brawl Box)), via [[Daily Chores]] monthly rewards (14 days), or by trading with other players (they are mailable). [/item][item]Each hour, you get 5 attempts to fire off bottle rockets, and you can bank up to 25 attempts.[/item][item]Select a shield to defend yourself, and choose your attacks wisely! Each attack will target 5-10 players at random, and uses bottle rockets ((bottle rocket)) from your inventory.[/item][item]Wooden shields ((wooden shield)) are strong against Strike Shot (brown), green shields ((green shield)) are strong against Blast Shot (green), and red shields ((red shield)) are strong against Inferno Shot (red). Try to guess what other players might be using![/item][item]If you get hit, you'll lose HP and one of your chosen shields. If you run out of shields, nearly every attack will hit! You recover 100 every hour, but if you reach 0, you'll have to wait until the top of the next hour to fire more bottle rockets.[/item][item]Each successful hit will earn you an event token ((event token)).
