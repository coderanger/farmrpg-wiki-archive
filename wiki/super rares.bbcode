These items have a very low drop rate.  Some are guesstimated to be 1 in 50,000 or lower!  Quite the prize to find them all!

[b][color=orange]If you use a Super Rare item for a quest, donation to [comm], ect, it WILL still show on your profile.[/color][/b]

Click &quot;Spoiler&quot; to see where to find them. Also if you find it, probably [[dont sell it]].
