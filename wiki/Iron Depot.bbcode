[center][size=17][b][color=mediumaquamarine]Iron Depot Perk[/color][/b][/size]:
Auto-purchases iron ((iron)) and nails ((nails))and keeps them at your max inventory. It does not require Ironworks but the perk still costs silver to buy the iron and nails. Also this perk removes Iron and nails from the dropping while exploring.  This increases the chance for other items to drop.[/center]

[[Ironworks vs Iron Depot]]


People occasionally encounter a glitch where iron and nails stop being purchased. This is a known issue. You may have ran out of silver, remember that it auto purchases iron and nails. Otherwise, go to the [cs] and buy one iron or one nail which should &quot;jump start&quot; the perk.
