[center][size=15][b][color=mediumaquamarine]Iron Depot[/color][/b][/size]: Auto-purchases iron and nails when you use them to keep them at maximum inventory. Does not require Ironworks and it still costs silver. [b]Also[/b] removes Iron from the drops in a zone.  This increases the chance for other items to drop.
