[center][size=15][b][color=mediumaquamarine]Iron Depot[/color][/b][/size]: Auto-purchases iron and nails when you use them to keep them at maximum inventory. Does not require Ironworks and it still costs silver. [b]Also[/b] removes Iron from the drops in a zone.  This increases the chance for other items to drop.

Please note: People occasionally encounter a glitch where iron and nails stop being bought. This is a known issue. You might have ran out of silver, remember that it auto purchases iron and nails. Otherwise, go to the country store And buy one iron or one nail, that should &quot;jump start&quot; the perk.
