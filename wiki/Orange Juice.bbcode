Restores 100 Stamina[/center]

Orange juice ((orange juice)), also knows as OJ, gives you 100 stamina when you drink while [[Exploring]].

You can go over your stamina cap and not lose stamina. When you do go over, it just means that you do not recover stamina every 2 minutes. The stamina recovery starts again after you go under the cap.
