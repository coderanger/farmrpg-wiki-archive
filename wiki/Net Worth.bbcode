Currently Net Worth is based on the amount of Silver you have, Silver in the [Bank], total [[Wine Cellar]] value, value of items stored in the [[Storehouse]] and the sum of sellable items you have. Net Worth does not take into account any perks that affect the sale price of items held in our inventory.

Farm additions and upgrades as well as pets are not part of Net Worth currently. Steak/Kabobs are not counted either.

Net Worth is visible on player profiles and there are 2 [achievements] that can earn you [[Gold Currency]] for having high net worth.
