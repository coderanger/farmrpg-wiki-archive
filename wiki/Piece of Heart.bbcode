[s]A Poem, by [user]Moonlight[/user]

In fields of green, beneath the sun's bright glow, So many watermelons in endless rows. With hope renewed, I plant each verdant seed, Searching for the heart piece my soul does need. The vines stretch out, their tendrils interlace, In this vast garden, I seek my heart's embrace. Yet every fruit, though sweet and round and fair, Yields not the treasure hidden somewhere there. Alas, I ask, where is the prize I seek? For countless melons, the search seems so bleak. Yet still, I toil, my heart remains steadfast, In every seed, a dream of finding it at last. So many watermelons, endless in their spree, But hope is the harvest that sustains me. For in each planting, though no heart piece found, I grow in patience, with each seed in the ground. One day, I'll find it, this I know is true, The heart piece hidden in the morning dew. Until that day, I'll plant and dream and fight, So many watermelons, in this endless night[/s]
