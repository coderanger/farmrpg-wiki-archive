You see THE TOWER in the distance … 

… and you hear rumours of a ((Tower Key))

I wonder what we'll find inside. If we can ever get this door unlocked!

Are YOU ready for The Tower?

From [updates] 22 Feb 2022: 

THE TOWER - FAQ
- Yep, The Tower is showing up under Explore the Area!
- I wanted to clear up a few things though because in the hype of it all some people are confused.
- First, The Tower is NOT a regular Exploration zone. It works differently.
- The Tower Key cannot be obtained yet, but a Help Request line is almost ready to make that possible.
- You'll need to be in the low 90s to start working on the Tower Key Help Requests.
- More details to come....
