The story begins when an archeologist, Paul Langford in 1928 unearthed a large alien ring-like object in the desert if Giza.  This artifact had 36 strange symbols, or hieroglyphs, on its face. It was made of an undiscovered form of metal.  Found in close proximity to the ring were multiple items. One of those items was ((Ring of Renthisj)). The Egyptian authorities took the artifacts where they were studied but no new information about their origin or use was uncovered. In 1939 the Americans took the object to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Nazis. It was then moved around to different locations in the U.S and was studied further for a potential weapon. Without progress the project was largely abandoned but Paul Langford's daughter, Catherine, continued her research with the United States Air Force to unlock the secrets behind the object. Over the years they learned this was device that worked like a rotary dial. The device has nine prominent points (chevrons) spaced equally around its circumference. With a high electrical current they could get the face of the ring to spin. As it spun the chevrons would lock onto different symbols creating unique addresses. The assumption was that the device was an alien teleportation device. They were unable to get the device to complete a full nine point address that would make a connection to another location. In 1994 an unsuccessful archeologist name Daniel Jackson was recruited and he broke the code for the device. Once a completed address was put in the center of the ring turned into a thin water-like membrane that allowed passage to another similar device across the universe. There are thousands of these devices amongst the stars with their own addresses. 
The devices were created by the an alien race  'The Ancients' millions of years ago. Today universe has many humanoid aliens with starships.   These aliens are in constant battle with each other for control of the universe and the lesser humanoids amongst the planets. One such alien ruler was named Renthisj. He was a 'God' of the Egyptian people thousands of years ago. He used Earth as a breeding ground for humans which would be used as slaves or hosts for themselves. There was an uprising during one of the human harvests and Renthisj was attacked by one of his own name Ra who lusted for power. Ra was able to kill Renthisj and wore the Ring of Renthisj to show to all that he was now in power.

How has the Ring of Renthisj come into your hands?  That is a story we will have to investigate.
