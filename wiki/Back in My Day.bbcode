We walked to school uphill both ways in the snow!

We crafted one at a time and waited hours for our [[autocrafting]]!

We got our fishing addict 3 without double hooks or Cat’s Meow ((Cat’s Meow))!

We GM'd our crops without Breakfast Boost ((Breakfast Boost))!

We could only get ((Grab Bag 07)) from capybara  and before that we could only get gold fish from manually tapping!
