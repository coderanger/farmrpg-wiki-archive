• We walked to school uphill both ways in the snow!

• We crafted one tap at a time and waited hours for our [[Autocrafting]]!

• Bank and vineyard perks actually made sense math wise. Silver was hard to get!

•Storehouse was capped at +2 growth per day!

•We couldn't grow ((Mushroom)), our only option was to explore for them!

• [BF] did not exist, [[Find It]] was the hottest library page around

• 300 Large Nets were 100 gold in trade chat and 600 OJ was 100 gold

• We GMed all board related items before Craftworks came out!

• We GM'ed sand before Jundland Desert was available! (Yes, lol, sand is craftable)

• Before the kitchen, we had about 500 million farming XP that didn't come from buildings and buying crop row during XP bonus made a huge difference. No matter what, we had to spend weeks farming beets to get the XP for 99 farming!

• We got {{fishing addict iii}} without double hooks, Crazy Hooks or Cat’s Meow ((Cat's Meow)), one fish at a time!

• Runestones ((corn)) 11 and ((eggplant)) 20 had no shortcuts, just you, the earth and your farm

• If you [[Accidental Beets]], you were just out of luck, no way to dig them up!

• We GM'd our crops without Breakfast Boost ((Breakfast Boost))! In fact none of the meals existed.

• We could only get ((Grab Bag 07)) from capybara  and before that we could only get gold fish from manually fishing, not even any ((mealworms)) to make it easier!

• We had to wait a full 24h to get Orchard fruits and Antlers. T160 and 170 [[Artifacts]] didn't exist!

We had no cookies, and barely any grape juice uses per day!

Fish didn't bite, we had to catch them ourselves! (one at a time and not even any ((mealworms)) to make it easier)

We had to keep our [[Tawny Owl]] at level 5 to get out of [[Honey Jail]] faster!

We had to actually tap on the shadow for ((mealworms)) to work!
