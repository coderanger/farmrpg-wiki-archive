We walked to school uphill both ways in the snow!

We crafted one at a time and waited hours for our [[autocrafting]]!

We got our fishing addict 3 without double hooks or Catâ€™s Meow ((Cat's Meow))!

We GM'd our crops without Breakfast Boost ((Breakfast Boost))!

We could only get ((Grab Bag 07)) from capybara  and before that we could only get gold fish from manually tapping!

We had to wait a full 24h to get Orchard fruits and Antlers!

We couldn't grow ((Mushroom)), our only option was to explore for them!

We had no cookies, and barely any grape juice uses per day!

Fish didn't bite, we had to catch them ourselves! (one at a time)
