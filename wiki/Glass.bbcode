A common question is &quot;Where is the best place to get glass?

[item]Ember lagoon is the best. Not only can you get glass orbs ((glass orb)) directly.[/item][list][item]You can also get emberstone ((emberstone)), which combines with sandstone ((sandstone))(you get tons from quarry), to get Unpolished Shimmer Stone ((Unpolished Shimmer Stone)).[/item][item]USS ((Unpolished Shimmer Stone)) turns into Shimmer stone ((Shimmer Stone))[/item][item]Smimmer Stone ((shimmer stone)) then combines with stone ((stone)) to get glass orbs ((glass orb))[/item][/list]
[b]Helpful Tips:[/b] If you are making lanterns ((lantern)), you need coal ((coal)). Mount Banon drops coal ((coal)) and ((Unpolished Shimmer Stone)) and then you can use ember to get the rest of the glass needed. Banon also gives carbon spheres ((carbon sphere)) which are just great all around, either for trading or making steel.
