As you acquire most items, you will progress towards mastery of that item, and earn rewards at specific benchmarks.

- [b]Note:[/b] Inventory overflow ([[The Void]]) counts toward mastery.
- Not all items have mastery levels.
- Mailed items do [b]not[/b] add to mastery. All other sources of item do add to mastery count
- You can check mastery progress from Home. Scroll down to &quot;Mastery Progress&quot; below skill levels.  Items are grouped in descending order of progress by Mastery Tier.
- Click on any item ((twine)) to see Mastery Progress, you can collect rewards there too.
- The bonus percent is an extra 10% after sell perks.[s]For example, if you are selling an item for 100 silver and you have 60% sell perks, you would get 160 silver. If that item is mastered, you would get an additional 10%, multiple 160x1.1=176. If it is GMed, you multiply it by an ADDITIONAL 10% for a total of 193 silver[/s][line]
