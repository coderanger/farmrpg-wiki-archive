[list][item]Mastery and Grand Mastery earned prior to the release of the Tower counts towards your AK, so you retroactively got points for all of your efforts so far.[/item][item]In addition, you have been retroactively given credit for all daily chores and chore rewards that you have completed since chores were released in February.[/item][item]Technically, AK was implemented at the same time as chores, so you have been earning AK behind the scenes for chores ever since.  Credit was given for masteries and grandmasteries at AK implementation and you have been earning AK behind the scenes for everything since.[/item][/list]
