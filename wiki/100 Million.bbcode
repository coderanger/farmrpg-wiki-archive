What should you do with 100 million? Here are some suggestions in general order of importance.

- 100 million +2 daily [[Storehouse]]. See [[Inventory Growth]] for why this is so important

- [[Level 5 Owl]] for more honey! [[Honey Jail]]

- Be sure your [[Orchard]] is maxed out for your inventory size so you get the maximum possible fruit daily. More fruit = More juices = More stamina = More everything!

- 100 million crop row gives you 100 million farming xp (one for every silver spent) and makes those crop quests and masteries a bit easier

- Keep those other production buildings up, especially the ones used in [[Sawmill Silver]]


Most other, non Owl, pets are really not all that useful until you get them to level 6 (1 billion silver). See [[Pet Guide]] for more info
