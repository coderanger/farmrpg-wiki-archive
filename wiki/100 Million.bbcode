What should you do with 100 million? Here are some suggestions

- 100 million +2 daily [[Storehouse growth]]. See [[Inventory Growth]] for why this is so important
- [[Level 5 Owl]] for more honey!
- Be sure your [[orchard]] is maxed out for your inventory size. Aka, be sure you are getting max possible fruit daily. More fruit = more juices = more stamina = more everything
- 100 million crop row gives you 100 million farming xp (one for every silver spent) and makes those crop quests and masteries a bit easier
- Keep those other production buildings up, especially the ones used in [[Sawmill Silver]]
