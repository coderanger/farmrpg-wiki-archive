The Large Net Launcher gold perk makes it so you can use multiple Large Nets ((large net)) at one time. You can set the launcher amount to any number from 10-50. Note that this perk does not work for small nets ((fishing net)).

You can change the amount of nets used in [Settings] using this setting [img]https://i.imgur.com/FxbclfV.png[/img]
