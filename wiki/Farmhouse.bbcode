[color=crimson]JUNE '22 UPDATE[/color]
If your current stamina is below your max, you will continue to gain 2 stam/minute (4 with perks). Nothing new with this.

[b]If your current stamina is at/above your max[/b], every 3 hours your farmhouse will bank stamina equal to your maximum. You can collect this once daily when you rest. 
Simple math: If you always have over max stam, multiply max stam by 8. That's how much banked stam you'll get next time you rest. See spoiler tab for more detailed explanation.[s]Your daily &quot;rest&quot; will now collect banked stam AND increase your max by 1-2.
Example: Your maximum stamina is 500. You drink 6 orange juice, and now have over max. Every 3 hours, if your current stam stays above 500, your farmhouse will collect +500 stamina.
At the next reset, you will have 4,000 stamina (500 x 8) waiting to be collected. If you skip a day of resting it will continue to stack.
