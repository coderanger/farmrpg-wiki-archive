Each subsequent timer is also 20 minutes.  WARNING: You cannot gain bonus mastery unless you have had one of the meal in your inventory, so either ((Fruit Punch)) your first cook or trade for the meal.[/item]
[item] A 5 minute timer starts at the end of which you can season your meal for a random amount of bonus XP.   If you season, you start a new 30 minute timer to season again for more bonus random XP.  Each subsequent timer is also 30 minutes.[/item]
