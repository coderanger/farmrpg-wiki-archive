[center]On the third day of the first month, the second year at sea, I saw an island in the distance. We found three buildings on the island: a blue barn on the eastern shore, a red shack on the beach closest to us, and off in the distance, a looming black tower. We decided it would be wise to investigate the buildings before making camp.[/center]

[s]Decide which building to check out first:

[color=red]If you found this, congrats! The rest of the adventure is still being written, make sure to check in often. Feel free to message me to let me know you've gotten here though -king[/color]
[color=transparent]As you go on your journey, make sure to keep track of everything you see/find. This includes any items you pick up, as well as your path around the island. Enjoy![/color]
