You find a small clearing nearby with a few logs arranged around the remains of a fire. It seems that other members of the crew had been here not long ago, and you decide this is the perfect place for you to settle in for a bit of relaxation while you prepare and eat your lunch.

You walk around the edge of the forest gathering some sticks and small branches to rebuild the fire.
