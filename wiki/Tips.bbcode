#5 What fruit to upgrade? All are good but if you don't have easy access to glass bottles then upgrade apples. If you have bottles then upgrade oranges. In general you probably want to keep them close because of the way that the cost scales but letting lemons lag for a while is fine early on. They get better when you can make Arnold Palmers
#6 If you get an &quot;Open items at locksmith&quot; chore, ask in giveaways chat for a few ((treat bag 02)) to open or go to small cave and try to find a few ((grab bag 02)). Even easier is to buy a few ((5 gold)) in the flea market and open them in your locksmith. You can do this as many times as necessary.
#7 Go to bed before midnight for a healthy sleep cycle and be excellent to each other!
#8 Steak trading in general makes very very little profit compared to almost anything else, do it if you enjoy it otherwise don't worry
#9 Storehouse is super important! See [[Inventory Growth]][/d]
[line][b]C. Been around awhile? Check this section out[/b][d=Details]#1 [[Late Game Crafting Advice]]
#2 Once you unlock tower, be sure to actually buy the artifact perks in your perk points or gold perks
#3 See [[kp]] for great mastery ideas and suggestions
#4 As tempting as it is, I would suggest to hold of on going for fish masterys till you get the T70 perk [[Artifacts]]. Those extra 100 fish per large net makes a big difference[/d]
