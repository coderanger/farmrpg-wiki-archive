There are 3 main ways to &quot;tag&quot; someone in chat to mention them.

1.) Type @username: with a : after, like &quot;@KoalaCorgi: hello!&quot;

2.) Click the users emblem in chat to start a new message with the user tagged:

3.) Go to their profile, then click their name; this will copy their tag and you can paste it.
