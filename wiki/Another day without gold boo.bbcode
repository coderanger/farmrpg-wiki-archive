[center][color=green]I fish all day
I cast my bait and wait
But I never find it

That glorious golden shoe
Days and days I have searched
My hands can take it no more

It seems like ages that Iâ€™ve been here
This Large Island has become my nightmare
My sanity fades

The sun is setting
My time is done for this day
Sadness fills my heart once more
