...or does he? ((buddystone))


When you explore small cave, Buddy will occasionally jump out and scare you, making you loose some of your stamina. He just wants to be friends! Once you do the &quot;Let's Play Pirates&quot; questline and have a buddystone ((buddystone)) in your inventory, you will no longer loose stamina.
