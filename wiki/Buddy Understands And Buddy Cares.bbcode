...or does he? ((buddystone))


When you explore small cave, Buddy will occasionally jump out and scare you, making you lose some of your stamina. He just wants to be friends! Once you do the &quot;Let's Play Pirates&quot; questline and have a buddystone ((buddystone)) in your inventory, you will no longer lose stamina. The ((buddystone)) isn't mailable, but that's okay because he doesn't need it back!
