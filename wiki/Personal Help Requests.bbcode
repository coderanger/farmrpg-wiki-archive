[color=mediumaquamarine][b]Scaling Difficulty:[/b][/color]
Personal Help Requests (PHR) unlock at level 60 farming. These are randomly generated help requests that scale to your level.
PHR take into account your current skill levels, zones unlocked, inventory cap, and item rarity.

Complete these at your leisure. Once all 3 are completed, 3 new ones will generate at the following reset.

Additionally, you can purchase 3 PHR for 10 gold if you don't want to wait for reset. [b]New PHR will not appear until the current ones are completed.[/b]

[color=mediumaquamarine][b]You will never have more than 3 PHR at a time.[/b][/color]
More will only generate at reset if your current set of 3 are completed.

[color=mediumaquamarine][b]Items that shouldn't show up for requirements:[/b][/color]
Event items, Wishing well exclusives, Exchange center exclusives, other unobtainable items.
While this is in beta, it's possible that you'll see an item that fits in one of the categories above. Please let a Farm Hand or Ranger know so we can relay it to firestream.
