- The new March Starter Pack gives you 100x Spring Seeds

- Spring Seeds can be planted to produce random flowers. Each seed will yield 10x of one of the following: ((red flowers)), ((blue flowers)), ((white flowers)), ((orange flowers)), ((yellow flowers))

- For the first half of March the only way to get Spring Seeds will be from the Starter Pack. The seeds will become available in a few places later in the month to ensure free to play folk can get their hands on them.
