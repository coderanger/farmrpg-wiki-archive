Is your screen zoomed in and you can't seem to fix it?  This is an unfortunate issue affecting Android devices (Samsung, etc).

[quote]This seems to be caused by a recent Samsung update to Android system WebView. Try fully powering off, waiting a minute, and turning it back on. If that doesn't help, find the Android system WebView app in your app settings and uninstall its updates. You may also need to turn off auto update for that app in the Google play store to prevent it from happening again[/quote]

Unfortunately, there's not a way for FarmRPG to fix the issue since it's caused by the device itself.
