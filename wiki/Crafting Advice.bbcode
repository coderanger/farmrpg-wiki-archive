Most of the time what you want to craft is items that return GOOD SILVER ... here is a simple list to follow as you level

((Iron Cup)) -  level 1*  (Get stone from exploring or by going to giveaways chat, buy iron in [cs])
((Awl)) - level 11* (Get stone and wood from exploring or giveaways, buy iron from [cs])
((Wooden Button)) - level 11* (Make in tandem with awl)
((Sturdy Shield)) - level 20* ([[Sawmill Silver]])
((Fancy Pipe)) - level 46* (Purchase and keep your [[Quarry]] upgraded for stone)
[center][b]Special note: Craftworks gives NO crafting xp so only use it for low XP things like twine, or for offline stuff if you are gone for awhile[/b][/center]((Lantern)) - level 70* ([[Glass]])
[[Late Game Crafting Advice]] - level 80ish

NOTE: to have them working best you will need good board/wood/stone production at buildings and follow the [[Sawmill Silver]] process AND have 60% selling bonus (negotiator skill perks)
