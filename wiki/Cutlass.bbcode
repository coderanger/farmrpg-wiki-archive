Looking for ((Cutlass)) for Intruders Beware or other quests? Look no further!Â 
[list][item]The primary source of cutlass is the [ec] where there is both a 1 time trade of 350 frogs and a regular trade of 350 spiders for 3 ((Cutlass)).[/item][item]The frog trade will show up until you trade it in, which you can only do once, however the spider trade will show up randomly forever same as the other items. Frogs are very difficult to find, so it is suggested wait and do the spiders trade first. See [[Exchange Center Guide]] for more information.[/item][item]The [Temple] has a sacrifical chain of 50 ((Tribal Staff)) for 3 ((Cutlass)). This chain is expensive, but if you are fishing a lot in Large Island, it can be a worthwhile option. The sacrifical chain also gives 100 ((Large Net)), some ((Treasure Key)), and some silver.[/item][item]1 ((Cutlass)) can be found in the [[Lost Nights and Lost Reindeer]] adventure[/item][item]3 ((Cutlass)) can be found by getting Lorn to level 20. See [[Gifts]] for items to donate to Lorn to level up his friendship.[/item]
[item]It is suggested to focus your first set of ((Cutlass)) on the Intruders Beware quest before the Unexpected Visitors, A Wall In The Way, or any other quests. See [[Rare Items and Locked Locations]] for the suggested order to do main quests.[/item][item]Once you have gotten 50 ((Cutlass)) in total, they have a chance to show up in [[PHR Rewards]] very rarely.[/item][/list]
Looking for many ((Cutlass)) for the Strange Companions questline?
[s][list][item]The Strange Companions questline asks for 50 ((Cutlass)) twice. It is recommended to work on the A Way Back/Far Away questline while doing Strange Companions, as you receive 100 ((Cutlass)) from completing Far Away XII.[/item][/list][/s]
