[b]What is an event?[/b]
[s]An event is a specific period of time that usually coincide with a major US holiday like Halloween, Christmas, easter etc.... The developer [user]Firestream[/user] wants it to be a fun time and gives out some bonuses and usually some limited time quests. They usually happen once a month.[/s]
