All the different bait used to fish! All of these have the same chance to catch fish. None catch more gold fish, for example, than another. The differences between baits are the speed you can use them and the XP gained per fish.
[list][item]Worms ((worms)) just your standard bait, used to catch a fish. This is the only bait you can buy from the country store. Once you reach level 10 fishing, you can buy the [[Worm Habitat]] to automatically get worms every hour. Mailable![/item]
[item]Grubs ((grubs)) This bait gives you twice as much exp. as worms! You can get them from the [[Trout Farm]] at level 15 fishing. Mailable![/item]
[item]Minnows ((minnows)) This bait does not give extra exp., but it makes fish spawn faster! Also obtainable from the [[Trout Farm]]. Mailable![/item]
[item]Gummy Worms ((gummy worms)) The coolest bait. 3x exp. AND faster spawn time. Obtainable in your [[Worm Habitat]] at level 40 fishing. Mailable![/item]
