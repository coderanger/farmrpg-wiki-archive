[s] This big girl is Zizi. She is a rescue so we are unsure what she is but supposedly some mix of German Shepard, Lab, and Boxer.[/s]

[s] Apollo (right) and his friend Gemma (left) who he now lives with. Apollo was our second dog (after Strider) but had to be rehomed as we just couldn’t give him the enrichment he needed. He is a German Shepard and Husky mix. [/s]
