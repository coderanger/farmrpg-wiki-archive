[s] Strider was brought into this world from his Rottweiler mother and miniature poodle father. We don’t ask questions.[/s]

[s]Freki is mostly German Shepard but he has some Australian Cattle Dog in him  that makes him shorter. He looks like a German Shepard with his legs chopped in half.[/s]

[s] This big girl is Zizi. She is a rescue so we are unsure what she is but supposedly some mix of German Shepard, Lab, and Boxer.[/s]

[s] Apollo (right) and his friend Gemma (left). Apollo was our second dog (after Strider) but had to be rehomed as we just couldn’t give him the enrichment he needed. He is still happily living with the family he went to. He is a German Shepard and Husky mix. 

Update: On January 13, 2024, Apollo passed away. He spent his last hours alongside the family who adopted him. He was diagnosed with acute kidney failure just days earlier and vet care could not be established without an initial down payment of $1,400. Unfortunately, there was not enough time for the money to be raised.[/s]
