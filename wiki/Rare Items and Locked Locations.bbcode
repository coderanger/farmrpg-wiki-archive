They will appear eventually, we promise. Some can take days/weeks/thousands of crops to find.
[s][b][i]Expeditions/Charters[/i][/b] can NOT find runestones. Nets and lemonades CAN.
[b][i]Crop Runestones[/i][/b]: Harvest the related crop. The harvest all perk does not affect this. 
Double prizes perks do not increase RS droprates, but makes it so you can get two at once when it finally does drop.

[b][i]A quest wants runestones[/i][/b] or another hard to come across item.
-Will it be returned? If you're a low-medium level player, you'll most likely get it back. Once you get to late game, you'll have plenty of runestones, and townsfolk might want to keep them.

You can access the zone at exploring level 80 but will only be able to manually explore, and there is a chance that a sandwyrm will appear and steal some of your stamina (10% of your total, with a max of 10k stolen).

[color=Darkturquoise]To do this, complete the following quests (you may already have some done): Fellow Farmer -&gt; Hard at Work -&gt; Unlikely Pair -&gt; Unexpected Visitor. Then craft ((Y73841 Detector)) using the quest reward: ((Y73841 Blueprint))[/color]

Once you have your ((Y73841 Detector)) you will have full use of the zone, and the wyrm will stop attacking you![/s]
