[center][size=18][b]New Player Perk Guide Part 2[/b][/size]
[size=18][hl=red][b][u]This is an unofficial, player-made guide![/u][/b][/hl][/size]
Guide by [user]PopcornFireworks[/user] and last updated on December 28, 2022. This information is all the opinion of the author and should be followed at your own risk.[/center]

[b]This guide is just my recommendations, and may or may not work for you and your playstyle.[/b]

[size=16]This page is a continuation of the [[Perk Suggestions By PF]] and has the Skill Point Perks.[/size]

You get one perk point every time you level up a skill, and one perk point for every item you master (but not grandmaster).

This means you will get a lot of points fast at the beginning when levels are easy, then hit a lull once leveling slows down but you do not have enough resources for most masteries yet. So, you want to make sure to get the perks you need to progress to late game before points become scarce!

This guide assumes you don’t plan to reset your perks frequently.  

[b][size=17]Top Recommended Perks[/size][/b][s]
[item]Negotiator I-IV (5, 15, 30, and 50 points)[/item][list][item]It’s free silver! The sooner you get these the faster you can progress.[/item][item]Start with I & II since they are cheaper, get III & IV when you can (possibly after resource saver).[/item][/list][item]Resource Saver I (10)[/item][list][item]Craft 10% more items from the same materials. Super important for both profit and mastering items to get more perk points.[/item][/list][/s]
[b][size=17]Get these next[/size][/b][s][item]Quicker Farming I-IV (5, 15, 30, 50)[/item][list][item]You will be growing so many crops, this will speed your quest progress up significantly.[/item]
[item]With all 4 Quicker Farming perks, crops grow in half the time. Add both Irrigation System perks from the Farm Supply and crops grow in 1/5th the time.[/item][/list]

Wanderer I-IV (1, 3, 5, 10)
Conserve your hard-earned stamina! You need a lot of stamina at all points in the game, so this is a good investment. 
If you feel like you are struggling to have enough stamina to complete quests, it is a good time to buy these perks (and invest in your orchard!). 

Double Prizes I & II (25, 50)
Get these AFTER all the Quicker Farming perks. 
40% more crops is good, but not as good as Quicker Farming (all QF perks is twice as many crops per time, all QF and Irrigation System’s combined 80% is 5 times as a many crops).[/s]
[b][size=17]Great once you hit certain milestones[/size][/b][s]
Forester I & II (10, 20)
You can’t afford to buy more trees OR your inventory is bigger than your orchard space. 

Double Hooks (25)
You are doing a lot of manual fishing. If you are fishing mostly with nets, this can wait until you need gold fish (the Pirates Cove and ATI questlines). If you really like manual fishing and/or you are going for the merit badge, this is very helpful. If you haven’t unlocked the forest for antlers yet, get that and try using fishing nets before considering this perk. 

Energy Drink (25)
You are an active player with a high stamina cap. Your stamina rarely fills up to maximum. (Before getting this perk, make sure you understand how the Farmhouse works). 

Animal Lover (15)
You want to regularly send cows or pigs to the Slaughterhouse OR you have found your first raptor egg. You do not need this perk for eggs and milk, it will be easy to pass your inventory cap without it.  

Raptor Sofa (15)
Once you get a raptor to level 10, get this perk.[/s]

[size=17][b]Good but not vital[/b][/size][s]
Artisan I-IV (5, 15, 30, 50)
In the early game, the silver cost to craft items is not very significant (most of the cost is buying iron and nails, which this does not affect), so these perks do not save much silver. It will add up over time, but other perks are usually a better investment. 
Once you have a steady income of runestones [[Pet Moneymaking]] these perks are useful for increasing your sphere profits. 

Please Recycle I (10)
10% chance to get a bottle back is only really noticeable if you are drinking hundreds of OJ a day, by which point you can spend a few of those OJ gathering more glass.[/s]

[size=17][b]What about the skill primers?[/b][/size][s]
You probably will not need the skill primers, with the exception of the Exploring Primer. There is enough to do in Farm RPG that you will get the experience you need from working on completing quests and masteries and getting silver. However if you have gotten stuck and are tired of grinding, the primers can be very helpful. Make sure to take a look at the actual number of experience points remaining in addition to your numerical level (level 92/93 is the halfway point!).

Once you have gotten a skill to 99 and no longer need the primer, you can reset your perks to get the points back. However, if you are not a Patreon Supporter it will cost gold to reset your perks multiple times, so plan ahead!

[size=14][b]When to consider the primer[/b][/size]

Farming Primer I (10)
You have bought the 1 billion silver crop row and have a ways to go before you reach lvl 99 (Farming Primer does not work for building upgrades). 

Fishing Primer I (10)
You have unlocked Lake Minerva and possibly Large Island but are not high enough level to unlock the Intruders Beware quest line for Pirates Cove (once you have PC you will have more XP than you know what to do with). 

Crafting Primer I (10)
Crafting is most people’s first 99. If you are feeling stuck, read Crafting advice and LGCA before buying this perk. 

Exploring Primers I & II (10, 25)
You have unlocked Whispering Creek and are dreading the grind to 99. This is the only skill where it is worth considering getting both primers, although primer II should be lower priority.[/s]

[size=17][b]Mediocre, only if you have everything else[/b][/size][s]
Vault Plans (15)
At farming lvl 99, the vault is 40 million silver per day. This adds an expected value of 8 million silver per day.

Bottle warmer (15)
Sounds good, but really isn’t all that much silver
Maybe consider if you have run out of things to spend perk points on[/s]

[size=17][b]Do not get these :([/b][/size][s]
Bait saver
Soon you will have more bait than you know what to do with.
If you are low on bait, ask in the giveaways chat, there are always people with extra.
Farming, Fishing, and Crafting primers II
You will get these skills to 99 way before you get to exploring 99.[/s][line]
