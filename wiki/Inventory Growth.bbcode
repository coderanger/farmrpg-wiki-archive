[b][color=crimson][size=20]Inventory Growth[/size][/color][/b]

[b]How it works:[/b] Visit your Storehouse and scroll to the bottom. Click/Tap the &quot;+2 Max Inventory Growth&quot; button to use silver to increase daily inventory increases.

[b]Why it is important:[/b] Doing that gives you a permanent +2 inventory every single day. More inventory per day at storehouse is super important. While getting +2 inventory space per day may sound small, it’s massive! 60 more FREE inventory space per month. More inventory space is EVERYTHING in this game!

[b]Note:[/b] Every day, after reset, you need to go to &quot;My farm&quot;, then click on &quot;Storehouse&quot; and &quot;Do some Work&quot; to actually receive the inventory increase.
