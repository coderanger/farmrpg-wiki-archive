[user]Borgen[/user] comes to town every Wednesday! He has some unique (and some less unique) items for sale! Borgen will generally sell 4-8 different items, all varying in price.

What's the catch? [b] He only accepts Ancient Coins (AC) as payment![/b]

He hasn't come enough for us to have a definitive list of all the types of things he sells yet, but below is a list of [b]some[/b] similarities we have noticed:
[list]

[item] ((trout)): 9999 ((ancient coin))[/item]
