What is the BITING! that sometimes appears?

- There is a chance now every 10 minutes that fish start biting more in a random Fishing Location
- This means when you fish there, you'll get 2-3 more fish per bait (similar to the event bonus)
- The chance of this happening is 1 out of 10 every 10 minutes and the bonus will last 10 minutes
