[b]What is the BITING! that sometimes appears in a fishing area?[/b]

- There is a chance, every 10 minutes, that fish start &quot;biting&quot; in a random Fishing Location
- This means when you fish there, you'll get 2-3 more fish per bait (similar to the event bonus)
- The chance of this happening is 10% every 10 minutes and the bonus will last 10 minutes.
- This does not effect fish caught with nets
- Biting catches stack additively with ((Cat's Meow)) and Double Hooks skill perk
