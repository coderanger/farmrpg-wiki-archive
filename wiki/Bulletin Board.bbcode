The bulletin board perk does two things. First it shows the percent of items that you have collected for a quest [img]https://i.imgur.com/8IqDC28.png[/img][line]

Also, on the farmers market page, it turns orange any items that are still needed for current or future quests so you don't accidentally sell them
