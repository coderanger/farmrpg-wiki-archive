Return to [[Perks]] page[line]
The bulletin board perk does two things. First it shows the percent of items that you have collected for a quest [img]https://i.imgur.com/8IqDC28.png[/img][line]

Also, on the farmers market page, it turns orange any items that are still needed for current or future requests so you don't accidentally sell things that you might need later. Keep in mind that this cannot include new requests that are not written or released yet. They are released regularly so you never know what items you might need in the future! [[Dont Sell It]]
