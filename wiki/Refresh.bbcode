Many checks in FarmRPG, like for achievements, merit badges, etc can be triggered by a forced refresh of the game from the home page. This also is important when new content is added and new assets/javascript that the game relies on is needed for things to work correctly. Refreshing from the dedicated button on the home page is NOT the same thing as pulling down to refresh or hitting the refresh button in your browser. If you're having some kind of graphical issue or not seeing an achievement you expect, the best first step is always to hit the refresh button!
