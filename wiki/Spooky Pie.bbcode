[b]What should I use ((spooky pie)) on?[/b]
- This is a frequent question. Commonly it is suggested to get two ((gold potato)) and a ((piece of heart)) because those items are needed for requests and can be hard to find normally. See [[Crop Drops]] for all things that drop from crops.

[b]Where do ((spooky pie)) come from?[/b]
-Originally in ((treat bag 05)) from October, 2023 [[Starter Packs]]
-A few late game quests have also given some since. See [bf] for more details. 
-They are tradeable, so you can try giveaways or trade chat. They do typically cost some gold, however, so your best bet is to ask trade chat for a rate check.
