[b]FIXED AS OF 7:55AM SERVER TIME[/b]

Today, January 15th a bit after reset a bug appeared that made planting crops impossible. Furthermore, if you use the plant all button, your seeds will be taken but no crops will get planted. [b][color=red]FS has already been notified, however he is already asleep, so it will have to wait until he wakes up to be fixed.[/color][/b] Please donâ€™t send new support tickets about this.

Sorry for the inconvenience.
