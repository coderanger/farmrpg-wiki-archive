This is simply a page for people who think typing 9 letters is hard, and 2 isn't. [[kings page]] is likely where you are trying to go. It's a great page, I highly recommend you check it out! I'm definitely not biased...

[b][color=darkcyan]Update on kings pages[/color][/b]
[s][center]I am in the process of moving/starting a new job. You may see me around the game, but I have limited access/time to update library pages, so expect little to no new updates or pages until Iâ€™ve settled in. (also a lot of my big pages like the mastery page and cw page utlize some scripts for formatting that I don't have access to for the time being). Thanks [/center][/s]
