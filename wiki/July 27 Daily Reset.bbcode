Daily reset seems to have broken on the morning of July 27, 2023. Firestream will fix it when he wakes up. It seems that everything during reset was finished, it is just the reset banner that is left at the top of home screen. Also the bank and steak market are both still closed. We apologize for the inconvenience and ask for your patience. Thank you.
