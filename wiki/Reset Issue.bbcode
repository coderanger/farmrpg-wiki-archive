The July 2nd reset did not fully complete. Some people did not get any Truffles. FS reran the Truffle drop at about 10:40 AM [[server time]] for all players. Thanks for your patience!

If the Home/Farm buttons are not working for you, you likely need to reinstall the app to correct it. Make sure you know your password before reinstalling!
