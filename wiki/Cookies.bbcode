[center][b][size=21]Where to find cookies?[/size][/b][/center]
All three cookies can be found as a trade deal in the [[House Of Cards]], a random drop from ((Borgen Bag 01)) (from PAMRATS, a late game quest), and from various event baskets: ((Bag of Presents 02)),((Box of Chocolate 02)),((Treat Bag 04)),((Treat Bag 05)). There are a collection of quests that give them as well. [bf] links under the spoiler:

[center][b][size=21]Tips for using[/b][/size][/center]
Always make sure to have ((grape juice)) uses available to be able to get the most use out of your cookies. I recommend using a ((breakfast boost)) along side your cookies so you can fill up on all of those crops after you have run out of your daily grape juice uses. If you fill up on BB crops, and still have time left on your cookies, several of the townsfolk like/love those crops [[Gifts]], eggplants can also be put in the [[Temple of Reward]]. If you have the space for meals, you can add a ((mushroom stew)) to get bonus mastery on the crops, or if not looking for mastery, you can use ((over the moon)) to get bonus friendship along side the ((breakfast boost))
