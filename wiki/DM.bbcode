DM stands for &quot;direct message&quot;. Direct message is a private message to a user in the game, NOT @ someone with a tag in chat. You can send a direct message by going to another players profile, by tapping their name in chat, and then tapping the green &quot;Message&quot; button at the top of the screen.
