[b]The Yellow Watermelon [temple] trade is available until the end of the month. You can also keep farming YWM until the end of the month[/b]

You can get Yellow Watermelon ((Yellow Watermelon)) from harvesting regular Watermelon. You have a 10% chance to get a Yellow Watermelon when you harvest.

Please note that this is in addition to your regular Watermelon. Most [[Crop Drops]] REPLACE the crop, however in this case you should get your full yield of ((watermelon)) as well as the additional ((Yellow Watermelon)).
