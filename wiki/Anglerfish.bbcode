People often ask where to get anglerfish ((anglerfish)):

[item]One way is the level 6 [[Frigate Macaw]] pet. While it is expensive to buy it and level up, it is one of the best single pets for generating silver. If you use the large nets it brings at Large Island and sell the fish, you can get between 42 and 50 million silver a day. It also brings in good items such as Crab Claws and Large Chest 02[/item]
[item]Another way is from the [Flea Market]. However that gold is usually better spent either for perks or in trade chat[/item]
