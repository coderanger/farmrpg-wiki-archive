[b][color=orchid]You were here once, and it changed your life forever. [/b][/color]

They were total strangers, with nothing in common
In giveaways for the first time. 
A farmer, a crafter, an explorer, a fisher, and a chef. 

Before they left giveaways, they learned the rules, 
Bared their souls 
And gave and received items
They never dreamed possible.
