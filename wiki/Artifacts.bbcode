[center]((Runecube))[/center]
[item][size=15][b][color=mediumaquamarine]Runecube[/color][/b][/size]: Floor 50 Reward.  Increases chance of finding rare items.

[quote=Tenfoo]The Runecube, when activated, reduces rarity by 20%. That affects exploring and fishing. If I understand it correctly, when you do an action like exploring or fishing, there is a dice roll that has this rarity value applied to it. With the runecube active, you have a lower rarity value. Since it’s applied at the roll, you may not see an exact 20% increase in getting stuff, due to rng, but you should see an increase in getting stuff overall.[/quote]
