Massive silver (MILLIONS per day)  in just a few simple steps.

Get to level 20 crafting (see [[Overview]])

* Build sawmill
* INCREASE boards per hour as high as can straight away.
* CRAFT all boards to wooden planks, wooden planks to sturdy shields.
* SELL ALL sturdy shields.
* REINVEST ALL SILVER into more boards per hour until at least 150-200 per hour.
* REPEAT over and over.

At 150-200 boards per hour, you should be making 5-10Million plus silver per day.  At that stage you can now buy any buildings and orchard trees to your heart content.

** Its essential to have all Negiotator perks (1-4) and Fertiliser I perk for 60% silver bonus when selling **

[b]How high can this go?[/b]
Some players have boards/wood/stone over 500+ per hour (and end game players over 2000 per hour!)! Making up to a hundred millions silver per day!  You need a massive inventory space to make it work, but if you are a very active player you can make a LOT of silver this way.

[b]What next?[/b]
If you are level 46 Crafting - ADD fancy pipes to sturdy shields and make more profit! (needs wood from sawmill, stone from quarry)
When you hit level 70 Crafting - ADD Lanterns for SIGNIFICANTLY more silver! (though you have to explore for the glass)

BEST silver in the game is fishing at Large Island (level 70 fishing).    150M per 1000 nets! You want silver… get to Large island!
Process -  explore a LOT in farm forest for antlers, make nets, and cast them in large island.  You can still do fancy pipes/sturdy shields whilst you do this. 

[b]What to do with all this silver?[/b]
Orchard orchard orchard!  Massive orchard gives you stamina to do everything in game.  Also extra inventory space per day in storehouse (starts at 10M silver) … then  other things in [[best upgrades]]

Enjoy the silver!
