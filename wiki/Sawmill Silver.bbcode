Massive silver (MILLIONS per day)  in just a few simple steps. (This sounds like a scam but it is not, we promise)

Get to [b]level 20 crafting[/b] (see [[Crafting Advice]])
[list][item]Build [[Sawmill]][/item][item]INCREASE boards ((board)) per hour as high as can straight away.[/item][item]CRAFT all boards ((board)) to wooden planks ((wooden plank)), wooden planks to sturdy shields ((sturdy shield)).[/item][item]SELL ALL sturdy shields ((sturdy shield)).[/item][item]REINVEST ALL SILVER into more boards ((board)) per hour until at least 150-200 per hour.[/item][item]REPEAT over and over.[/item][/list][b]Please Note:[/b] Its essential to have all Negotiator perks (1-4) and Fertilizer I perk for 60% silver bonus when selling. The Negotiator perks are skill perks found in the &quot;Unlock Perks&quot; on the home page, the Fertilizer perk is a gold perk in [farm supply]. 

[item]At 150-200 boards per hour, you should be making 5-10 Million or more silver per day.  At that stage you can now buy buildings and orchard trees to your heart content.[/item]
[item]When you are are [b]level 46 Crafting[/b], ADD Fancy Pipes ((Fancy pipe)) to what you craft regularly and make more profit! Pipes need wood from sawmill and stone from quarry. The best part is that you can use boards for shields and wood for pipes and craft both! You might also consider buying the [[Iron Depot]] perk, it helps quite a bit.[/item][item]When you hit [b]level 70 Crafting[/b] make Lanterns ((lantern)) for SIGNIFICANTLY more silver! (though you have to explore for the [[Glass]]). You might think about getting [[Craftworks]] for making ((twine)) at this point.[/item][line]
[b]How high can this go?[/b]
[s]Some players have Boards ((board)), Wood ((wood)) and Stone ((stone)) over 500+ per hour (and end game players even more)! Making hundreds of millions of silver per day!  You need a massive inventory space to make it work, but if you are a very active player you can make a LOT of silver this way.

For the best silver in the game, see [[Late Game Crafting Advice]]. Fishing at Lake Minerva, Large Island, and Pirate Cove is going to get you a bunch of silver as well as fishing xp.  You want silver? Grind toward Large Island and Pirate's Cove!
Process -  explore a LOT in farm forest for antlers, make nets, and cast them in your highest unlocked fishing zone of those three.  You can still do fancy pipes/sturdy shields whilst you do this.[/s]
