Massive silver (MILLIONS per day)  in just a few simple steps. (This sounds like a scam but it is not, we promise)

Get to [b]level 20 crafting[/b] (see [[Crafting Advice]])

* Build [[Sawmill]]
* INCREASE boards ((board)) per hour as high as can straight away.
* CRAFT all boards ((board)) to wood planks ((wood plank)), wood planks to sturdy shields ((sturdy shield)).
* SELL ALL sturdy shields ((sturdy shield)).
* REINVEST ALL SILVER into more boards ((board)) per hour until at least 150-200 per hour.
* REPEAT over and over.

At 150-200 boards per hour, you should be making 5-10 Million or more silver per day.  At that stage you can now buy buildings and orchard trees to your heart content.

** Note: Its essential to have all Negotiator perks (1-4) and Fertilizer I perk for 60% silver bonus when selling **

* When you are are [b]level 46 Crafting[/b], ADD Fancy Pipes ((Fancy pipe)) to what you craft regularly and make more profit! Pipes need wood from sawmill and stone from quarry. The best part is that you can use boards for shields and wood for pipes and craft both!

* When you hit [b]level 70 Crafting[/b] - ADD Lanterns ((lantern)) for SIGNIFICANTLY more silver! (though you have to explore for the [[glass]])


[b]How high can this go?[/b]
[s]Some players have Boards ((board)), Wood ((wood)) and Stone ((stone)) over 500+ per hour (and end game players over 3000 per hour!)! Making hundreds of millions of silver per day!  You need a massive inventory space to make it work, but if you are a very active player you can make a LOT of silver this way.

For the best silver in the game, see [[Late Game Crafting Advice]]. Fishing at Lake Minerva, Large Island, and Pirate Cove is going to get you a bunch of silver as well as fishing xp.  You want silver? Grind toward Large Island and Pirate's Cove!
Process -  explore a LOT in farm forest for antlers, make nets, and cast them in your highest unlocked fishing zone of those three.  You can still do fancy pipes/sturdy shields whilst you do this.[/s]

Enjoy the silver!
