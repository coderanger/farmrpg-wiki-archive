There are 20 [[Runestones]] hidden around Farm RPG that are used to unlock new exploring and fishing areas. Some runestones have easier ways to get them that are not obvious. Generally they are hard to get and the drops are very random. Most just require patience.

This is just the easiest way to get your first runestones. Check out [[Runestones]] for all of the ways and to get more info about what runestones are used for.

Note: You can NOT get Runestones from Expeditions or Charters.
