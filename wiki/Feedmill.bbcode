A gristmill (also: grist mill, corn mill, flour mill, [[feed mill]] or feedmill) grinds cereal grain into flour and middlings. The term can refer to either the grinding mechanism or the building that holds it. Grist is grain that has been separated from its chaff in preparation for grinding.

You wanted [[Feed Mill]] in this case. Not [[feedmill]].
