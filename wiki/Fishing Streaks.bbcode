The more fish you catch in a row without missing, the higher your manual fishing streak will go.

This helps you earn more fishing XP when [b]manually fishing only[/b]. Per spot, you get 10% for every 100 streak up to 1000 streak (so 100% bonus max,  0.1% per 1 fish in the streak). Streak bonuses only apply in the location of the streak, they don't stack across fishing locations. You can also earn a few [Achievements] for high streaks that reward [[Gold]].

[b]Fish nets do NOT count towards fishing streak, nor do fish caught with nets get the bonus streak exp.[/b]

The extra fish caught with the Double Hooks and Crazy Hook perks as well as extra fish from the Cats Meow ((Cat's Meow)) meal DO count toward your fishing streak.

Fishing with [[Mealworms]] ((mealworms)) does [b]not[/b] increase your fishing streak, but does get the XP benefit from your existing streak.

You can drink ((iced tea)) to restore a lost fishing streak. Iced tea can be found in help request rewards or purchased from the [Flea Market].  Iced tea can also be crafted using ((tea leaves)) and ((glass bottle)). You can ask in giveaways chat for one too, as they are mailable.

One of the [[Merit Badges]] {{Fishing Addict III}} can be earned by obtaining a 10,000 fishing streak in each of 10 fishing areas.
