[line][b]Would you like to be featured on the Farm RPG Player Spotlight segment?[/b] 
3 ways to do so:
[list][item]1) Schedule time to hop on Discord with Bhelogan, and do the interview with him. You will record your own audio locally (On a PC, with Audacity, or whatever software you use to record audio, or even just on your phone, using a headset), and then upload them to a google drive. If you can't record your audio locally, a Zoom call can be set up instead.[/item][item]2) Record yourself answering the questions yourself on your time, and upload the audio file to the google drive[/item][item]3) Not comfortable with having your voice recorded? Just answer the questions on paper, and Bhel will read them for you.[/item][/list]
Feel free to ask [user]Bhelogan[/user] any specific questions on how to do any of the above.
Questionary:
[list][item]1) How did you learn about Farm RPG, and how long have you been playing?[/item][item]2) In one sentence, describe Farm RPG[/item][item]3) Where did your (Farm RPG) username come from?[/item][item]4) Besides Farm RPG, what games do you like to play?[/item][item]5) What is one thing you wish the Farm RPG community knew? [/item][item]6) Tell us an interesting fact about yourself.[/item][/list]
