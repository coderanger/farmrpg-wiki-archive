[size=18][color=#86eda0] Nomination ((100 gold)) Giveaway![/color][/size]
The main goal of the nomination giveaway is to recognize individuals who have a positive effect on this community. There may be times when a quirky or cute nomination is given out or times when it’s given to people most in need. My hope is, that by recognizing positive behavior, we reinforce the type of community we want to see in order to make this game a more positive experience for all of us and make us better people.

3rd ((50 gold)) smol winner! @GoosesForDays: “They helped me all thru out my ATI and most of my tower masteries and silver to climb to where I am now which is t60. They didn't asked for anything in return. They entertained all my questions about the game as I'm starting. I wouldn't be in my tower level now if it wasn't for them.”

4th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @rattea: “He helped me a lot early game by giving me a bunch of info and help whenever I needed it. He would also give me early game stuff that would help me a lot and he never asked for compensation.”

5th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @sargetoad: “he has helped me soo much and i didnt even told him to help me or something… he gave me like 5k fishing nets (normal because i don't have lvl 99 fishing) and he gave me some tips and links about where to get cooking recipes. ohh and also like 2k orange juice for nothing.. he's a really good person.”

6th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @Shield Krash: “I’d like to nominate ShieldKrash for encouraging me all the way and sharing strategy tips and often items”

7th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @spooneroni: “spooneroni for constantly being a source of laughter and good cheer for mailbox wars with fun items and messages of encouragement and generally being a fun person in chat. ??”

8th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @Kukuudu: “he gave me an absurd about of help with this game. ((Aggressive Kindness)) to an exponential degree. I can't thank that person enough”

9th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @ilovethemets90: “He’s a perfect example of healthy competition and someone that keeps up with you and motivates u for more progress. Though we have different in game strengths ( i will not admit this but he def beats me in the giveaways department) he always works to help other players out especially newer ones or those grinding for those big milestone quests! Plenty of good things to say about him and his contributions to the game. He has been super excited for the Christmas event since it would be his first and I’ve been hyping it up. Since he’s also F2P any sort of gold would be awesome for the holidays.”

10th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @Valkyrie: “I'm not sure if they're raiding just my mailbox or secretly gifting many people from the shadows, but always give me stuff I need the most unprompted. So I'd like the opportunity to give back, because I can never catch them online or with an empty mailbox.”

11th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @Akima1211: “i want to nominate my girlfriend Eva. I think she should win since she's really doing a lot for me, helping me around the house and just mentally and financially supporting me. She's my first GF and has been doing an amazing job! Due to her work she doesn't have a ton of time to play, so I thought that this giveaway could maybe help her out!”

12th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @Akiren: “I would like to nominate my husband and best friend Akrien. He is always willing to send me fishing nets when I need it and not to mention is a wonderful dad to our son (out of game lol). I think he is the greatest and loves this game as much as I do”

13th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @TBasgen: “I started this game at the urging of a mutual friend, and upon my start TBasgen sent gifts and tips to excel at the game - for quite a while! He's known in our group of friends as the &quot;Rich Uncle&quot;, and his whole goal in the game is to give away things that will help new and other players continue to enjoy the game. For example, he's mentioned that he grows lots of grapes so that he always has some on hands for new players who accidentally craft theirs before getting to the quests.”

14th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @Bitterbits: “Bitterbits made me feel very welcome in the chat. She is always positive and helpful. I see her connecting with others sharing her fun sense of humor as well as encouraging and supporting everyone along the way.”

15th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @Grace316: “Grace316 for the giveaway for her tenacity to stick with this game for a year and a half despite being totally blind and using a screen reader to play. Manual fishing is out of the question, but at least now she can get gold fish through the exchange center.”

16th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @MellowFellow: “He agreed to a trade with me in a larger size than my inventory... Not just that, but he also offered to hold some items and keep in contact if I ever wanted to trade again. When I told him I was working on some masteries and grinding tower, he sent me quite a stack of foods to buff my journey unprompted and was just so nice to talk with in DMs after the trade. I really appreciated how welcoming he was to me directly and just showed some kindness out of nowhere from simply talking to me!!”

17th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @DrunkenClam: “ I started new a few days ago and DrunkenClam has helped me with some initial snowball's and gold for my mailbox, he was very friendly and gave me tips on how to progress in game”

18th ((50 gold)) smol winner! @ilovecows: “she's actually really active in the community and has given away a lot of stuff. She's also the one who introduced me to FarmRPG! We know each other IRL and she would tell me about corn jail, herb jail, honey jail, etc. I didn't know what any of it meant so I'd think to myself &quot;why so much grind, how is this fun?&quot; So I tried it out, and I ended up loving it here! I just hit 4x99 because of her”

7th ((100 gold))((cornucopia)) winner! @Stukspoonia: “Ever since I joined Farm RPG, he has been giving me a bunch of orange juice and veggies to help me progress in the game.

I really really appreciated the help and the answers to my followup questions.”

11th ((100 gold))((cornucopia)) winner! @Chloe: “Everyone knows Chloe is generous, but she has a way of sensing when I need a mental pick me up. And then just says exactly the right thing. I'm not even sure she's consciously aware of it. But she definitely has a way of lifting my spirits, in way that no amount of gold could. And it's not just me. The entire community seems more alive when she shows up. And I can just feel that she actually cares. Anyone can be generous. Not everyone cares. And let's not forget that awesome attitude and sense of humor.”

18th ((100 gold))((cornucopia)) winner! @Narancia: “because of the lemonade stand they run like clockwork, it’s practically a feature of the game but they do it by themselves with their own resources. it’s just so nice.”

19th ((100 gold))((cornucopia)) winner! @Hook: “for the awesome random mailbox drops, the message on the profile telling everyone no reciprocity or thanks needed, and the in-character pirate-ness. When Hook comes into giveaways the mood totally shifts. Fun person.”

He's been playing for a long time and somehow is still holding on and playing, despite all the changes and so many people leaving. And we can't forget the famous Alfredo giveaway style™ Guy's a real OG and will always be one of the big names and capy gang who made giveaways a great place, and kept so many people playing.”

((100 gold))((100 gold))((treat bag 04))((lovely present))((christmas present 07))((Christmas card))((spooky cookies)) @AJtheSecond: “He just really believes in people's potential and likes to give people a chance to show it. I wouldn't be this far so quickly without him. He likes to &quot;strap a rocket on a new players farm and see where they go with it&quot;, to paraphrase his own words. And he'll give anyone a chance. I actually can't remember him ever saying anything negative. Ever. The closest it gets is clear and obvious jokes and those are hilarious. I consider him a true friend. There are a few times I just needed someone to talk to and he listened. Every time. And he made sure I knew I wasn't bothering him. And I'm sure he'd do that for absolutely anyone. He was the one of the first to believe in me.”


2nd grand prize winner! ((100 gold))((100 gold))((heart container))((christmas present 07))((spooky cookies)) @Rkm13: “Rkm is genuinely one of the most positive, helpful members of the community and staff team alike. They're constantly in help chat answering questions for both new and old players. They also keep making and updating library pages to enable players to help themselves out, with super useful information. Always friendly, and willing to help however they can, this community can never give enough to pay back the kindness Rkm has shown us.”

3rd grand prize winner! ((100 gold))((100 gold))((treat bag 04))((lovely present))((christmas present 07))((Christmas card))((spooky cookies)) @lunarSpoonrad: “lunar is an incredible friend; I love talking to her. She always brings a kind attitude to chat and she's generous. I love seeing her in chat! When I started out she helped me with a lot of stuff, be it stamina items or nets, and she wouldn't take no for an answer or accept any kind of tips. And this kindness hasn't stopped in all that time. She helps anyone, stranger or friend, selflessly with whatever they might need.”

4th grand prize winner! ((100 gold))((100 gold))((heart container))((christmas present 07))((Christmas card))((spooky cookies)) @Kateryna: aka Chaos Queen, “She's always such a positive vibe and so willing to help out other players. When I'm hanging around giveaways she's one of the people I see most often. She's personally helped me many times and I think she's just so deserving!”... “Kat puts in the time to host fun (and chaotic) games, she makes giveaways a better place in general. We are really lucky to have her!”

5th grand prize winner! ((100 gold))((100 gold))((treat bag 04))((lovely present))((christmas present 07))((Christmas card))((happy cookies)) @JulesShaun: “She is the heart and soul of Help Chat. I jokingly call her our patron saint but it’s true. She gives an enormous amount of her personal time and resources most days to help make this community as wonderful as it is. Jules Knows Best is our slogan. Jules is patient, kind, and wonderfully witty. I’m so glad this game gave us the opportunity to become friends.”

[s]
[color=#21b245]Can I nominate someone who didn’t win again?[/color] 
Yes.

[color=#21b245]The library said to PM you, so is that a private message, or can I also nominate in chat?[/color] 
Please privately message me your nomination and why you are nominating that person.

[color=#21b245]How do people win gold? [/color] 
First, you have to be nominated by someone. Once nominated, I and one other person whom I invite to review the nominees will decide the people most deserving of the gold based on their generosity, kindness, and the positive impact they have in the Farm RPG community. 

[color=#21b245]How much gold does the winner get? [/color] 
Usually 1 ((100 gold)) per winner. However, sometimes the prize might vary or multiple golds could be given out. Just depends on the situation. 

[color=#21b245]What do you mean by writing why they should be nominated?[/color] 
There are a bunch of players in the game constantly running in and out. There’s no way I’ll know every single player out there. By providing a [color=#21b245]detailed[/color] reasoning on why someone should be nominated, you can provide me with information that I cannot or would not know that helps me better understand your nominee. 

[color=#21b245]Do I get something for nominating?[/color] 
No. Nothing except a sense of pride and happiness for your nominee if they win. 

[color=#21b245]Can I nominate myself?[/color] 
No. 

[color=#21b245]What is a “smol winner”?[/color] 
It means they were chosen because they were recognized as positive, giving, or special on an individual level but not quite yet on a community level. 

[color=#21b245]Can a smol winner be nominated again for the month?[/color] 
Yes, smol winners can be nominated again for 100 gold for the month!

@Jim slaps: 19th 100 gold winner! “he’s pretty quiet in giveaways chat, but he occasionally makes his appearance by filling random mailboxes with oj lem or apple cider, also occasionally trout. He also stubbornly refuses to upgrade his mailbox, insisting that a small mb is good for his “character”, thus blocking out all the gifts he could receive in return. He is truly an enigma, but also a unique part of the giveaways community.”

@waitasec: 20th 100 gold winner! “The time and resources he puts into helping out other players is incredible. Not only has he made hefty contributions to several people’s xp/EB pushes leading up to the event, but he goes out of his way to help any player he sees who needs it with stam, mats, alllll the nets, and game advice. He’s spent a decent chunk of this week being my own personal calculator because my “inefficiency” makes him “sad” and has gone above and beyond to help me out. And he does all this really quietly, and often anonymously, actively shunning any credit or recognition. Just the kindest person.”

@KevinJ09: 21th 100 gold winner! “He is always looking to help out anyone who needs it, and never by halves. If Kevin helps you, he does it in the most excessive way possible and absolutely refuses any kind of gift in return - to the point of removing his mb not just once, but twice. He is the most stubbornly generous person and watching him wear Rosie down until she upgraded her mb, and then Obsebian until he accepted help with EB, was the most excellent entertainment in chat. I adore him!”


There is one individual that really stood out in the nomination. They will be awarded 100 gold + large medium and smol pot of gold!


@Thumpur: MVP winner! “He helped me dozen of times, but what's more important I see that he is spreading the &quot;will to help&quot; among other players. I think that's how this great community is rising.”
