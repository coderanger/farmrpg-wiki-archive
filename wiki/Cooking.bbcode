To start cooking, you must be Farming 75 and Crafting 75. You can add the Kitchen by going to &quot;My Farm&quot; and then &quot;Farmhouse&quot;

[item]Most recipes will require Cooking Pots ((cooking pot)), so you will need to craft those. They require ingredients from Ember Lagoon, so you'll need to have access to that location as well[/item]

You cook food in ovens.  You unlock ovens by leveling your cooking skill.  Each oven costs 1 billion silver
[s]
[item] First oven is included when you buy your kitchen [/item]
[item] Second oven - Cooking 2 [/item]
[item] Third oven - Cooking 5 [/item]
[item] Fourth oven - Cooking 10 [/item]
[item] Fifth oven - Cooking 20 [/item]
[item] Sixth oven - Cooking 35 [/item]
[item] Seventh oven - Cooking 50 [/item]
[item] Eight oven - Cooking 70 [/item]
[item] Ninth oven - Cooking 90? [/item]

[/s]

After you select a meal to cook, you get three ways to interact with that oven:
[s]
[item] A 1 minute timer starts at the end of which you can stir your meal for a 10% reduction in the remaining cook time.  If you stir, you start a new 15 minute timer to stir and reduce the remaining cook time by 10% again.  Each subsequent stir timer is also 15 minutes.[/item]
[item] A 3 minute timer starts at the end of which you can taste your meal for a bonus mastery to the meal type you are cooking.   The bonus amount is +1 and +1 for each 30 minutes of base cook time for that recipe.  If you taste, you start a new 20 minute timer to taste again for more bonus mastery.  Each subsequent timer is also 20 minutes.  WARNING: You cannot gain bonus mastery unless you have at least one mastery in that meal.[/item]
[item] A 5 minute timer starts at the end of which you can season your meal for a random amount of bonus XP.   If you taste, you start a new 30 minute timer to season again for more bonus random XP.  Each subsequent timer is also 30 minutes. [/item]
