To start cooking, you must be Farming 75 and Crafting 75. You can add the Kitchen by going to &quot;My Farm&quot; and then &quot;Farmhouse&quot;

[item]Most recipes will require Cooking Pots ((cooking pot)), so you will need to craft those. They require ingredients from Ember Lagoon, so you'll need to have access to that location as well[/item]
