To start cooking, you must be Farming 75 and Crafting 75. You can add the [[Kitchen]], for 500 million silver, by going to &quot;My Farm&quot; and then &quot;Farmhouse&quot;
[item]Most recipes will require Cooking Pots ((cooking pot)), so you will need to craft those. They require ingredients from Ember Lagoon, so you'll need to have access to that location as well[/item]

Each subsequent timer is also 20 minutes.  WARNING: You cannot gain bonus mastery unless you have had one of the meal in your inventory, so either ((Fruit Punch)) your first cook or trade for the meal.[/item]
[item] A 5 minute timer starts at the end of which you can season your meal for a random amount of bonus XP.   If you season, you start a new 30 minute timer to season again for more bonus random XP.  Each subsequent timer is also 30 minutes.[/item]
