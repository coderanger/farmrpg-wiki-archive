[item]White Truffles ((white truffle)) and Black Truffles((black truffle)) are gathered by your pigs. In order for your pigs to gather truffles, you need a Pig Collar ((pig collar))[/item][item]You can get the ((Pig Collar)) by doing &quot;The Smell of a Fun Guy&quot; (fun guy, fungi, get it?) questline. You need to be 99x4 and tower level 1 to unlock the questline[/item][item]After you get the collar, at server reset, your pigs will find ((White Truffle)) or ((Black Truffle)). This only happens if you feed your pigs.[/item][item]You can then take the truffles to the [steaks] to sell[/item][item]If enough people sell their truffles daily the chance for a price increase at the next server reset increases (but is not guaranteed). If people hoard and dont sell, the price might stay lower for longer... so by selling you are helping bring up the chance for more profits the next day[/item][item]The more pigs you have at high levels will give you a greater chance to find truffles of both types[/item][item]Similar to wine, kebabs and steak, truffles are not effected by event or meal bonuses.[/item]
