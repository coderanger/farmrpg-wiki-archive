Fish supplier is a perk that can be purchased with gold.

This perk does 2 different things. First, it adds a &quot;Sell All Unlocked Fish&quot; button to the main fishing screen so you don't have to go all the way to the Farmers Market to sell

It also adds a few buttons to the location information page. (Click the &quot;i&quot; button at the top of any fishing location screen to get to this page)

If you click &quot;Lock Shown Non-Gold Fish&quot;:
