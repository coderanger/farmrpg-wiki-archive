1. [color=#E07204][size=16]Always increase the 4 early skills of FarmRPG[/size][/color]
What, Where, Why, How to Farm, Fish, Craft and Explore!
[b][s][/b]
* Farm RPG skills: [[Farming]], [[Fishing]], [[Crafting]], [[Exploring]], (and [[Cooking]] which is unlocked later)
* As you increase these skills you get access to new things, new areas and new items that allow you to progress through the game and make more silver!

[size=18][[Farming]] Tips:[/size]
- always have crops planted and growing! 
- You get silver when you sell crops and farming experience to access more buildings!
- What to farm?
  ~ If you need crops for tasks/quests do those first!
  ~ If you are missing any farming [[Runestones]] do those crops
  ~ If you have the runestones, do the longest crop so you can spend time doing other things

[size=18][[Fishing]] Tips:[/size]
- A great source of silver early game
- Sell fish for silver at the market in town.
- KEEP ALL rare ones as they are often needed for tasks requests!
- Where to fish?
  ~ If you need fish for tasks/quests do those first!
  ~ If you are missing any fishing [[Runestones]] fish in those areas
  ~ If you have the runestones, fish in the latest location you have unlocked.

[size=18][[Crafting]] Tips:[/size]
- Makes you MILLIONS of silver, and makes you GOLD by finishing mastery!
- Take the items you find from exploring, and craft them into new items.
- What to craft?
  ~ If a task/quest needs a crafted item make it first!
  ~ Otherwise IMMEDIATELY start crafting A LOT of iron cups ((iron cup)) (stone from exploring, buy iron from store in town)
  ~ Then (level 13) craft iron cups AND wooden shields ((wooden shield)) (wood from exploring, buy iron and nails from store) 
  ~ ** At level 20 start making STURDY SHIELDS ((sturdy shield)) over and over - see [[Sawmill Silver]] **
  ~ At crafting level 46, swap to/add FANCY PIPES ((fancy pipe)) to your crafting mix!
  ~ Many Other items can be crafted for good silver and experience (eg horseshoes, rings, etc)

[size=18][[Exploring]] Tips:[/size]
- Exploring finds you items for crafting, [[runestones]], [[super rares]], chests, and other items
- Use all your stamina regularly, let it regenerate.  Then use it again!
- Fish at Farm Pond to regenerate stamina faster!
- Eat Apples or Orange juice to get more stamina points (you CAN go over your stamina limit safely!)
- Drink Lemonade to find 6-12 items instantly!
- Where to explore?
  ~ If you need items for tasks/quests explore there first
  ~ If you are missing any exploring [[Runestones]] explore in those areas
  ~ If you have the runestones, it is worth looking for other items (items for crafting, super rares, chests).

3. [color=#E07204][size=16]Skill Point Perks, Farm Supply Perks, GOLD and Inventory Size[/size][/color]
A crucial part of the game but make sure you pick the ones you need and not just buy everything!
[b][s][/b]
[b]NOTE - PERKS STACK!  You want to get all the important ones - Max Selling things Silver bonus is 60%, and Crop times can be reduced 80%![/b]

Skill Point Perks
- You will get more and more skill points perks as you level up your 4 skills.
- Early game the most important skill point perks are arguably:
  * Negotiator 1-4 (everything you sell you get more silver for)
  * Wanderer 1-4 (every time you explore you use less stamina)
  * Quick Farming 1-4 (drastically decreases crop times to grow)
  * Resource saver (you will craft thousand of items cheaper)

[Farm Supply]
- These are game perks bought with GOLD.
- Be careful what you chose as gold is limited.
- Some are needed early game others can wait!
- Farm Supply Perks considered essential early game are:
  * Fertilizer 1 (more silver!)
  * Irrigation Systems 1-2 (faster crops)
  * Resource saver (efficient/cheaper crafting)
  * Yes I am sure (removes a lot of confirmation buttons... its AMAZING)

Premium Currency - GOLD
- Farm RPG premium currency is [gold]
- There is plenty of gold to be found in-game by:
  * Building buildings on your farm (10 Gold each)
  * completing [achievements] (5-250 gold per achievement!)
  * finishing task requests (10-50 gold in some rewards)
  * Completing Mastery for items (5 Gold each)
  * some from [[mailbox passwords]]
  * OPTIONAL purchasing [gold].

Inventory Size
- arguably the MOST important gold upgrade in the game!
- Every time you think about spending gold on a perk think &quot;Do I need more inventory space&quot;.
- Players with bigger inventory space:
  * progress SO much faster!
  * make more silver by buying and selling more kebobs and more steaks.
  * hold more items in inventory!
- First few inventory space upgrades are quite cheap, but they get more expensive as you upgrade.
- Note you can get FREE inventory size by building the Storehouse!
