Help Chat Book Club ([[HCBC]]) is a club for people who enjoy spending their time in Help Chat and reading in the [Library].

[b]The HCBC slogan is: Help Chat Best Chat[/b]

Membership is open to anyone and everyone who enjoys helping their fellow players or simply likes books. A book icon or a &quot;Help Chat Book Club&quot; reference in your profile are optional.

[b]Warning:[/b] Help chat can devolve into topics such as tea, health, snacks, philosophy and investing. Also apparently the finer points of grammar. Be prepared for anything.
