Help Chat Book Club ([[HCBC]]) is a club for people who enjoy spending their time in Help Chat and reading in the [Library]. The club is most active around [[Daily Reset]] and during events to help answer questions.

Membership is open to anyone and everyone who enjoys helping their fellow players or simply likes books. A book icon or a &quot;Help Chat Book Club&quot; reference in your profile are optional

[b]Warning:[/b] Help chat can devolve into topics such as tea, health, snacks, philosophy and investing. Also apparently the finer points of grammar. Be prepared for anything.
