[[Ironworks]]: A building upgrade (which gives some farming XP). Main purpose: gives iron and nails, similar to how quarry and sawmill give items every X amount of minutes. Other possible items it can drop: ((small screw))((small spring))

[[Iron Depot]]: A perk that removes nails and iron from explore zones. It uses your own silver to [i][b]automatically purchase[/b][/i] iron and nails any time you have less than your max inventory. It just saves you a trip to the Country Store.
