[[Ironworks]]: A building that you can buy. Produces iron and nails every three minutes. Also occasionally drops ((small screw)) and ((small spring)).

[[Iron Depot]]: A perk that removes nails and iron from explore zones. It uses your own silver to [i][b]automatically purchase[/b][/i] iron and nails any time you have less than your max inventory. It just saves you a trip to the Country Store.
