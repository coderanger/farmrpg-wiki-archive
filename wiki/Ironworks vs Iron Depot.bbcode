[[Ironworks]]: A building that you can buy which produces iron and nails every three minutes. Also occasionally drops ((small screw)) and ((small spring)).

[[Iron Depot]]: A perk that removes nails and iron from explore zones, which increases the chance for other items to drop. It also uses your own silver to [i][b]automatically purchase[/b][/i] iron and nails any time you have less than your max inventory, saving you a trip to the Country Store.

[b]Note:[/b] Once you buy the iron depot perk, the iron and nails from ironworks just go into [[The Void]].
