[[Ironworks]]: A building that you can buy which produces iron and nails every three minutes. Also occasionally drops ((small screw)) and ((small spring)).

[[Iron Depot]]: A perk that removes nails and iron from explore zones, which increases the chance for other items to drop. It also uses your own silver to [i][b]automatically purchase[/b][/i] iron and nails any time you have less than your max inventory, saving you a trip to the Country Store.

[b]Note:[/b] Once you buy the iron depot perk, the iron and nails from ironworks just go into [[The Void]] and IW is basically useless so don't upgrade the production. However it does give XP from buying the building and drops small screws and springs occasionally so it is worth getting eventually.
