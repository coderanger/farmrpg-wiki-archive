The item &quot;Cat's Meow&quot; (and other item names that contain an apostrophe) uses a specific apostrophe that is hard to get to work correctly, so I made this page to get it right every time. You can also click on the item ((Cat's Meow)) and then click on the blue/green name at the very top of the item page to copy the item name.

Prior to July 2023, some items used a curly apostrophe [sub][b][size=24]â€™[/size][/b][/sub], which is the default on iOS devices. All items should now use straight apostrophes [sub][b][size=24]'[/size][/b][/sub], which you can usually access from the long-press menu if your device defaults to the curly one.
