[center][size=16][b]Exploring[/b] is a skill you can level up in FarmRPG.[/size][/center]
[line][center][b][color=orange][size=20]The Basics[/size][/color][/b][/center]
To explore, click &quot;Explore the Area&quot; on the Home menu. In the areas you can explore, you have the option to 'Continue' and see what happens. Each time you do this you use up stamina. Stamina refills 20 points every 10 minutes (40 per 10 minutes with Energy Drink perk enabled).

[b]How do I refill my stamina?[/b][s]
If you find apples, you can eat them while you are exploring to refill 15 stamina points.  Once you can make [[Orange Juice]], you can drink that to refill 100 stamina. Fishing with bait in the [[Farm Pond]] also helps recharge stamina.
[/s]
[b]How do I find items?[/b][s]
Just continue in each area and you will find items as you explore. You can also drink [[Lemonade]] to find multiple items at once.[/s]
[b]How do I get Exploring XP?[/b][s]
Every time you explore, you get 125 base experience, in all areas. You also get the XP added in for items you find while exploring. This is true, even if your inventory for that item is full. You don't get the extra item, but you do get the XP for it. See [[exploring xp]] for more in depth info.

In addition, you get 250 XP for drinking ((Orange juice)) and 25 XP for eating an ((apple))
