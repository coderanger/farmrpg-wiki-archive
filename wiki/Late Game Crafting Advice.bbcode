[center][color=#47cdbd][size=22][b]What's the best thing to craft for silver?[/b][/size][/color]
A guide by [user]Badymaru[/user][/center]

Disclaimer: This is general advice and what’s best may be slightly different depending on your perks or playstyle.

[color=#F0A050]All options require decent ((straw)) / ((wood)) production to keep up with ((twine)). Invest appropriately to keep up with your activity level.[/color]

[center] [size=19]TL;DR: ((Large Net)), ((Sturdy Bow)) & ((Lantern)) are all good[/size][/center]


[size=15][color=#47cdbd][b]Are you 4x99 and have Pirate’s Cove unlocked?[/b][/color][/size]
[s]Explore [[Forest]], craft ((Large Net)) Large Nets and use them in Pirate’s Cove.
This is the best way of making silver, especially after unlocking the level 70 and 90 Tower [[Artifacts]].[/s]

[size=15][color=#47cdbd][b]Do you just want to make money easily without thinking?[/b][/color][/size]
[s]Explore [[Forest]] and craft ((Large Net)) Large Nets. Use them in Pirates Cove, or Large Island if you don't have PC yet.[/s]

[size=15][color=#47cdbd][b]Do you still need Crafting and Exploring XP?[/b][/color][/size]
[s]Explore Whispering Creek and craft ((Sturdy Bow)) Sturdy Bows and ((Garnet Ring)) Garnet Rings. Plant Mushrooms for paste and get steel from [[steelworks]]. Use the fruit you get from exploring to continue exploring for more profit.[/s]

[size=15][color=#47cdbd][b]Do you not have access to Whispering Creek or Large Nets?[/b][/color][/size]
[s]Explore Ember Lagoon and Mt Banon (for coal) and craft ((Lantern)) Lanterns.[/s]

Honorable Mentions:
[s]((Blue Purse)), ((Red Shield)), ((Purple Bag)), ((Crossbow)), ((Fancy Drum)), and ((Fancy Guitar)) will bring in a good amount of silver when sold, but should not be prioritized over the things listed above. [/s]
