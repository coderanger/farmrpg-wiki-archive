[color=darksalmon]Is buying Gold pay-to-win?[/color][s]Answer provided by [user]Firestream[/user], the game developer

Somewhat, but since the game isn't competitive, getting an advantage from using Gold doesn't affect other players in the game. Gold can be used to activate some perks, add some QoL buttons and increase how much stamina or inventory you have.[/s]
