The [[Slaughterhouse]] is the place our livestock visits in the end.  When you call it [[Slaughter House]], that sounds kind of like a title for someone's house.  You know, like Purple House, or Castle House, or Haunted House.  Slaughter House is... uh... not a place anyone should like to go.  [[Slaughterhouse]], on the other hand, it a good, useful, safe (for humans) place.
